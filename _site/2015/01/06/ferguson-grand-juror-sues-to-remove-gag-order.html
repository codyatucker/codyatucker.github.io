  <p>In the suit, the juror contends that &ldquo;the investigation of Wilson had a stronger focus on the victim (Brown) than in other cases presented to the grand jury.&rdquo; The juror also states in the lawsuit that explanation of the law was made in a &ldquo;muddled and untimely manner&rdquo; compared with other cases that were presented to the grand jurors, who began their service in May.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;In Plaintiff&rsquo;s view, the current information available about the grand jurors&rsquo; views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges,&rdquo; according to the lawsuit. &ldquo;Moreover, the public characterization of the grand jurors&rsquo; view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with Plaintiff&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Under Missouri law, it is a misdemeanor for grand jury members to disclose evidence or information about witnesses who appear before them.</p>

<p>I assume it won&rsquo;t be long before a Missouri lawmaker tries to make it a felony.</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the unofficial summer season, between Memorial Day and Labor Day, America endured 26 mass shootings in 18 states. One massacre followed another, sometimes on the very same day. In sudden bursts of misery, they played out in big cities, along rural roads, inside trim suburbs. They left behind shaken neighborhoods, tearful memorials and calls for change, but little concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most defining issue of our time. People will look back on our inaction with sadness, confusion and anger. Rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sobering piece by Mitch Smith of the New York Times:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kuo: All Three iPhones Coming in 2020 Will Support 5G</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kuo: All Three iPhones Coming in 2020 Will Support 5G" /><published>2019-07-28T12:54:22-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-28T12:54:22-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g.html">&lt;p&gt;Juli Clover at MacRumors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The three iPhones expected to launch in 2020 will feature support for 5G, according to a new note to investors shared today by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and obtained by MacRumors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kuo originally said that two of the three new iPhones coming in 2020 will support 5G, but now believes that Apple will offer 5G in all models to better compete with lower-cost Android smartphones that will support 5G. Kuo also says that following Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s smartphone modem chip business, Apple has more resources for developing the 5G iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they’ll name this one “iPhone 5G”. They obviously didn’t do an “iPhone 4G” or “iPhone LTE”, but with all the buzz around 5G, it might be a decent way to get away from this awkward numbered naming pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Juli Clover at MacRumors:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Raspberry Pi 4</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Raspberry Pi 4" /><published>2019-06-24T22:04:23-05:00</published><updated>2019-06-24T22:04:23-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4.html">&lt;p&gt;This is just delightful.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The speed and performance of the new Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up from earlier models. For the first time, we’ve built a complete desktop experience. Whether you’re editing documents, browsing the web with a bunch of tabs open, juggling spreadsheets or drafting a presentation, you’ll find the experience smooth and very recognisable — but on a smaller, more energy-efficient and much more cost-effective machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-display support, up to 4GB of ram for $55, with the 1GB RAM model starting at the classic $35 price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they should have limited their options in favor of a singular model with, say, 2GB of RAM. The iPhone XR reportedly runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/576127/iphone-xs-max-xr-benchmark-geekbench-ram/&quot;&gt;3GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re obviously two wildly different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no point being speculative here. I just love that the Raspberry Pi exists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is just delightful.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a Linksys EA7500 with all the dual-band, 1.9Gbps MU-MIMO WiFi features. It would often stop working, forcing me to perform a hard reset and the wait for it to inevitably crap out again. It’s last firmware update was 8/29/18, and it’s not comparable with Open-WRT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time it stopped working, I gave up and set out for a new router. I live in a small apartment and don’t need anything fancy. Most of my devices are wired via Ethernet, with my phone and iPad using WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local buy/sell/trade store had a stack of 2011-12 Airport Extreme’s for $10 with a 30-day return policy. I took the chance and got the newest one they had. It’s been working like a champ since I got it, &lt;strong&gt;and it just received a security update&lt;/strong&gt;!

  &lt;p&gt;Shameful. It’s an embarrassment to the country and it is a stain on this institution. You should be ashamed of yourselves, for those that aren’t here, but you won’t be. Because accountability doesn’t appear to be something that occurs in this chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re taking another step in our hate speech
&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en&quot;&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; by
specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in
order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on
qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation
or veteran status. This would include, for example, videos that promote
or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory. Finally,
we will remove content denying that well-documented violent events,
like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s absurd that it’s taken so many years for YouTube (and Twitter and
Facebook) to finally make a move like this. This is basic stuff, yet these companies have spent roughly a decade showing an utter lack of understanding of the effects the rampant spread of misinformation has had on society. It’s lead to survivors being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.necn.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Jesse-Hughes-slams-Parkland-shooting-survivors--477949183.html&quot;&gt;abused online&lt;/a&gt; or in person. It’s even gotten people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/virginia-unite-the-right-rally-protest-violence&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should all be ashamed of themselves, and so too should we all for spending our time on their services while this literal tragedy played out before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This app works a lot like nvALT (and Notational Velocity, naturally). You pop it up and start typing. Search or create a note in seconds. It has blazing fast and accurate full-text search, the ability to find related notes based on content, and very complete Markdown editing tools (complete with syntax highlighting and theme editing). The biggest difference is that it works with multiple folders and sub-folders. You pick a folder, it indexes it, and you can use it just like nvALT. But then you can open another folder, or create a new one and start editing. It allows you to create folders anywhere, maybe one on Dropbox or iCloud Drive that’s shared, one on an encrypted disk that’s private, one for work, one for home, one for every writing project. You’re not limited to tags (though you can search by and sync with macOS tags within the app), and you can sort your notes into subfolders as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. My main request for nvAlt was always the ability to save to different folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides conspired or coordinated with the Russian government’s 2016 election interference, according to a summary of the special counsel’s key findings made public on Sunday by Attorney General William P. Barr.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Barr also said that Mr. Mueller’s team drew no conclusions about whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. Mr. Barr and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, determined that the special counsel’s investigators lacked sufficient evidence to establish that Mr. Trump committed that offense, but added that Mr. Mueller’s team stopped short of exonerating Mr. Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” Mr. Barr quoted Mr. Mueller as writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears Mueller found insufficient evidence of intent to conspire with Russia to influence the election, despite Russia’s attempts to do just that. He also punted on the question of obstruction, possibly due to the question of whether or not a sitting president can be indicted on such a charge. Thus, the obstruction question is left to Congress, and thrust squarely into the political foil in the run-up to the 2020 elections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">NY Times:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Zealand bans military-style weapons days after terrorist attack</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/21/nz-gun-ban.md.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Zealand bans military-style weapons days after terrorist attack" /><published>2019-03-21T09:17:30-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-21T09:17:30-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/21/nz-gun-ban.md</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/21/nz-gun-ban.md.html">&lt;p&gt;Anna Fifield at the Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand —  New Zealand has banned military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Thursday, just six days after attacks on two mosques in Christchurch that left 50 people dead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A buyback program will be launched to take existing weapons out of circulation, and gun owners who do not comply will be subject to fines, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“On 15 March, our history changed forever. Now, our laws will, too,” Ardern said. “We are announcing action today on behalf of all New Zealanders to strengthen our gun laws and make our country a safer place.”&lt;/p&gt;

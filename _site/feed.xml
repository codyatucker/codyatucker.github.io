&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to work in a native WordPress or Squarespace interface on an iPad with an external keyboard and trackpad? Imagine being able to use the full web version of Google Docs instead of the sub-par iPad apps? Imagine being able to do precise text selection on an iPad. This is what the iPad needs software wise. While touch-based interfaces have brought a lot of great innovations, I still struggle, ergonomically, to use them for hours as a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I really don’t understand why 9to5Mac went with this headline. Anyways, &lt;a href=&quot;https://brooksreview.net/2018/06/mobile-safari-is-holding-the-ipad-back/&quot;&gt;Ben Brooks&lt;/a&gt; makes a good case for Apple holding it’s ground here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because some product manager decided that their support response would be “use a desktop, sorry”. I don’t want iPad to have a cursor, because that’s not what iPad is. I want websites to pull their heads out of their asses and realize that there are far more people using mobile Safari than there are those sitting down at a desktop to work. Just as web designers had to learn to design responsive websites mobile first, web application developers need to make their apps work on iPhones and Android phones first and foremost, desktops second. Because if it works on an iPhone, it will certainly work on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is in a very strong position here, with so many devices in the world running mobile Safari. It helps that mobile Safari is arguably one of the best web browsers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chambers is a correct that Apple needs to keep working on interface solutions that offer &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to improve ergonomics in key areas—particularly for people with “laptop-like” use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that Apple is taking great care before adding traditional interface tools to iOS. Once they add cursor/trackpad inputs, they can’t really turn back, and doing so would risk limiting progress with touch interfaces as users revert to whatever is comfortable to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Bad headline, first of all, as Bradley Chambers is mainly arguing for better input options in the iPad.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Did exactly 4,645 people die in Hurricane Maria?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem: This is not a verified number, unlike body counts in wars. The Harvard study offers only an estimate – a midpoint along a broad range of possibilities. It is not based on death records, only estimates of deaths from people who were interviewed in a survey.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In effect, the researchers took one number – 15 deaths identified from a survey of 3,299 households – and extrapolated that to come up with 4,645 deaths across the island. That number came with a very large caveat, clearly identified in the report, but few news media accounts bothered to explain the nuances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard’s estimated toll was “a 95% confidence interval of 793 to 8,498, and 4,645 falls in the middle of this range.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four other studies estimated the death toll between 605 and 1,194, but Harvard’s study was quite different compared to the earlier ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quoted piece makes a good case that the actual death toll is closer to the earlier studies, and on the lower end of Harvard’s estimate interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s still a catastrophic loss of life from a disaster that doesn’t get enough attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Glenn Kessler:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Windows 10 April 2018 update adoption soars</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/30/win10-april-update.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Windows 10 April 2018 update adoption soars" /><published>2018-05-30T22:14:29-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-30T22:14:29-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/30/win10-april-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/30/win10-april-update.html">&lt;p&gt;Peter Bright:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By way of comparison, the previous update, version 1709 (“Fall Creators Update”) took about two months to reach 50 percent penetration, and the one before that, version 1703 (“Creators Update”) took around three months to reach the same level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The faster rollout suggests greater confidence within Microsoft that the update is relatively problem-free. Version 1803 hasn’t been immune to issues—it was blocked temporarily from installation on systems with certain SSDs—but the speed of the rollout suggests that it has avoided any major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great sign for Microsoft. Updating a Windows 10 machine is a far better experience than Windows 7. It’s also clear that users trust it to not make massively unsettling changes to their daily workflow, and the brisk adoption rate &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; aid security of a large swath of PC’s around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Peter Bright:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">iOS 11.4 brings Messages in iCloud</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/29/ios-11-4-messages.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="iOS 11.4 brings Messages in iCloud" /><published>2018-05-29T22:03:18-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-29T22:03:18-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/29/ios-11-4-messages</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/05/29/ios-11-4-messages.html">&lt;p&gt;Sarah Perez:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Messages in iCloud was first announced a year ago at WWDC 2017 as a way of keeping conversations up-to-date across all your Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac. Its introduction means you’ll now be able to access your entire Messages history when you set up a new Apple device, and, when you delete a message from one device, that change syncs to all your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing messages in iCloud should help clear up loads of space on device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this highly-sensitive data appears to be stored securely, ensuring that no one—including Apple—can access this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The messages are also end-to-end encrypted for security purposes. They’re protected with a key derived from information unique to the device, combined with the device passcode – which only the device owner should know. That means no one else could access or read the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that health-care disruption for the elderly and the loss of basic utility services for the chronically ill had significant impacts across the U.S. territory, which was thrown into chaos after the September hurricane wiped out the electrical grid and had widespread impacts on infrastructure. Some communities were entirely cut off for weeks amid road closures and communications failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico was hardly prepared to take on the response to the storm, but the federal government didn’t appear to be up for it either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital — only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government’s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them a week’s notice on the shutdown. Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Inmates in solitary confinement at Snake River spend 23 hours a day in cells with no windows to the outside world; their outside-the-cell time is spent in a concrete-enclosed exercise room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But during the course of Nadkarni’s one-year study, half of the 48 prisoners in a solitary cellblock got to watch nature videos of their choosing projected on a wall in the room during the 45 to 60 minutes they spent there each day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The videos projected in what inmates called the &amp;ldquo;blue room&amp;rdquo; included imagery of forests, beaches, and Earth viewed from space. Inmates in the other half of the cellblock took their exercise time as usual, without being exposed to any nature videos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What happened? According to surveys and interviews conducted at the conclusion of the study, 43 percent of the inmates who were allowed to watch the nature videos said the videos soothed them. “When I first went into the blue room, I was like ‘wow, how beautiful this world is,’” one of the inmates said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that health-care disruption for the elderly and the loss of basic utility services for the chronically ill had significant impacts across the U.S. territory, which was thrown into chaos after the September hurricane wiped out the electrical grid and had widespread impacts on infrastructure. Some communities were entirely cut off for weeks amid road closures and communications failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico was hardly prepared to take on the response to the storm, but the federal government didn’t appear to be up for it either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital — only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government’s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magicforce seems nosier than the Das. The new board has Gateron Brown keys, which are supposed to copy the heralded Cherry MX Brown. Upon first use, I think I prefer the real Cherry MX Brown. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the form factor is much, much better. Not even close, really.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them a week’s notice on the shutdown. Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all of these “build your own platform” arguments aside, this move should have a serious impact on Medium’s credibility—not just as a service or a platform—but as a company.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Jon Russell at TechCrunch:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“The Martin Luther King You Don’t See on TV”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/15/the-martin-luther-king-you-dont-see-on-tv.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“The Martin Luther King You Don’t See on TV”" /><published>2018-01-15T14:35:32-06:00</published><updated>2018-01-15T14:35:32-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/15/the-martin-luther-king-you-dont-see-on-tv</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/15/the-martin-luther-king-you-dont-see-on-tv.html">Jeff Cohen and Norman Soloman for Fair.org in 1995:

  &lt;p&gt;What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Inmates in solitary confinement at Snake River spend 23 hours a day in cells with no windows to the outside world; their outside-the-cell time is spent in a concrete-enclosed exercise room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But during the course of Nadkarni’s one-year study, half of the 48 prisoners in a solitary cellblock got to watch nature videos of their choosing projected on a wall in the room during the 45 to 60 minutes they spent there each day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The videos projected in what inmates called the &amp;ldquo;blue room&amp;rdquo; included imagery of forests, beaches, and Earth viewed from space. Inmates in the other half of the cellblock took their exercise time as usual, without being exposed to any nature videos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What happened? According to surveys and interviews conducted at the conclusion of the study, 43 percent of the inmates who were allowed to watch the nature videos said the videos soothed them. “When I first went into the blue room, I was like ‘wow, how beautiful this world is,’” one of the inmates said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over 24 hours, the greater Houston and Galveston area received 24.1 inches of rain. The National Weather Service warned of “additional catastrophic, unprecedented and life threatening flooding” into the next week, and placed flash-flood emergencies for all of Southeast Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the Post says no evacuation order was issued in Houston. That’ll raise questions about the city’s storm preps, but save that for later. This event is expected to play out over the next several days, and it looks progressively dire as it develops.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event took place on Sunday in Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. More than 1.5 million people from all walks of life, ranging from students and housewives to government officials, planted a total of 6,67,50,000 tree saplings in just 12 hours. A total of 24 districts of Narmada river basin were identified for the plantation. The saplings included two-dozen varieties of plants sourced from different nurseries around the state.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The record of planting maximum saplings was earlier held by Uttar Pradesh, another Indian state, which planted nearly 50 million trees in a span of 24 hours in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;First, Like and Retweet counts update dynamically, so you can see instantly the engagement generated by a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Second, you can add filters and stickers to your profile photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Third, and most welcome of all, links now open in Safari instead of Twitter’s own browser. This means that you’re now logged into websites where you have an account. It also provides access to Reader View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks a lot better than the previous app, and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it took so long to implement Safari View Controller. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of text everywhere all the time, and it remains too hard to access lists, which I use now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Tweetbot and Twitteriffic allow me to set tabs at the bottom of the screen for quick access feeds dedicated to news, soccer, tech and automotive news. For example, this allows me to keep the minute-to-minute noise of the news cycle outside of my main feed, yet it&amp;rsquo;s always available the second I want to dive in. List support adds a remarkable layer of depth to the Twitter experience, and the service is significantly less useful without it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="twitter" /><category term="tech" /><category term="iphone" /><category term="app" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html">Ben Lovejoy at 9to5 Mac:</summary></entry></feed>

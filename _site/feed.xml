&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The NBA season is balance with the league’s board of governors and players due to meet on Thursday morning to discuss whether to continue with the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Milwaukee Bucks, arguably the best team in the NBA, boycotted their playoff game against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday in protest at the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Blake, who is black, was shot seven times in the back by a white police officer on Sunday, apparently in front of his children. His family say Blake is now paralyzed from the waist down. The shooting occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee. The town has since seen demonstrations, which turned deadly when two protesters were shot dead. A 17-year-old has been charged with murder over the killings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The NBA subsequently postponed all three games due to take place on Wednesday, and other leagues such as the WNBA, MLB and MLS also cancelled some, or all, of their games on Wednesday. Play at the Western &amp;amp; Southern Open tennis tournament was also cancelled for the day. In the NFL, the New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts and Washington were among the teams to cancel their practice sessions on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Twitter announced Tuesday that it has begun taking sweeping actions to limit the reach of QAnon content, banning many of the conspiracy theory’s followers because of problems with harassment and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Twitter will stop recommending accounts and content related to QAnon, including material in email and follow recommendations, and it will take steps to limit circulation of content in features like trends and search. The action will affect about 150,000 accounts, said a spokesperson, who asked to remain unnamed because of concerns about the targeted harassment of social media employees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The spokesperson said that as part of its new policy, the company had taken down more than 7,000 QAnon accounts in the last few weeks for breaking its rules on targeted harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has taken them &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; to make to make this decision, all while people around the world were subject to relentless abuse from groups stirred up by coordinated misinformation campaigns and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter didn’t just fail to take responsibility, it &lt;em&gt;avoided&lt;/em&gt; taking responsibility, and that is inexcusable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Robert Mueller: Roger Stone remains a convicted felon, and rightly so</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/07/11/mueller-stone-op-ed.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Robert Mueller: Roger Stone remains a convicted felon, and rightly so" /><published>2020-07-11T17:42:51-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-11T17:42:51-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/07/11/mueller-stone-op-ed</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/07/11/mueller-stone-op-ed.html">&lt;p&gt;In an op-ed for Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the unofficial summer season, between Memorial Day and Labor Day, America endured 26 mass shootings in 18 states. One massacre followed another, sometimes on the very same day. In sudden bursts of misery, they played out in big cities, along rural roads, inside trim suburbs. They left behind shaken neighborhoods, tearful memorials and calls for change, but little concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most defining issue of our time. People will look back on our inaction with sadness, confusion and anger. Rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sobering piece by Mitch Smith of the New York Times:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kuo: All Three iPhones Coming in 2020 Will Support 5G</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kuo: All Three iPhones Coming in 2020 Will Support 5G" /><published>2019-07-28T12:54:22-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-28T12:54:22-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/07/28/iphone-5g.html">&lt;p&gt;Juli Clover at MacRumors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The three iPhones expected to launch in 2020 will feature support for 5G, according to a new note to investors shared today by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and obtained by MacRumors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kuo originally said that two of the three new iPhones coming in 2020 will support 5G, but now believes that Apple will offer 5G in all models to better compete with lower-cost Android smartphones that will support 5G. Kuo also says that following Apple’s acquisition of Intel’s smartphone modem chip business, Apple has more resources for developing the 5G iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they’ll name this one “iPhone 5G”. They obviously didn’t do an “iPhone 4G” or “iPhone LTE”, but with all the buzz around 5G, it might be a decent way to get away from this awkward numbered naming pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Juli Clover at MacRumors:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Raspberry Pi 4</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Raspberry Pi 4" /><published>2019-06-24T22:04:23-05:00</published><updated>2019-06-24T22:04:23-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/06/24/raspberry-pi-4.html">&lt;p&gt;This is just delightful.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The speed and performance of the new Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up from earlier models. For the first time, we’ve built a complete desktop experience. Whether you’re editing documents, browsing the web with a bunch of tabs open, juggling spreadsheets or drafting a presentation, you’ll find the experience smooth and very recognisable — but on a smaller, more energy-efficient and much more cost-effective machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-display support, up to 4GB of ram for $55, with the 1GB RAM model starting at the classic $35 price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they should have limited their options in favor of a singular model with, say, 2GB of RAM. The iPhone XR reportedly runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/576127/iphone-xs-max-xr-benchmark-geekbench-ram/&quot;&gt;3GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re obviously two wildly different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no point being speculative here. I just love that the Raspberry Pi exists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is just delightful.

&lt;p&gt;I had a Linksys EA7500 with all the dual-band, 1.9Gbps MU-MIMO WiFi features. It would often stop working, forcing me to perform a hard reset and the wait for it to inevitably crap out again. It’s last firmware update was 8/29/18, and it’s not comparable with Open-WRT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time it stopped working, I gave up and set out for a new router. I live in a small apartment and don’t need anything fancy. Most of my devices are wired via Ethernet, with my phone and iPad using WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local buy/sell/trade store had a stack of 2011-12 Airport Extreme’s for $10 with a 30-day return policy. I took the chance and got the newest one they had. It’s been working like a champ since I got it, &lt;strong&gt;and it just received a security update&lt;/strong&gt;!

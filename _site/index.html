      <p>Testing the new keyboard. It’s a new Magicforce 68, replacing the Daskeyboard Ultimate that I’ve used since around 2012.</p>

<p>The Magicforce seems nosier than the Das. The new board has Gateron Brown keys, which are supposed to copy the heralded Cherry MX Brown. Upon first use, I think I prefer the real Cherry MX Brown. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Otherwise the form factor is much, much better. Not even close, really. The Magicforce even includes media keys—accessible by the Fn key—which is a huge upgrade from the Das.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2018/05/18/medium-paywall-dead.html">Medium suddenly shutters paywall program</a></h1>

      <p>Jon Russell at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/mediums-latest-pivot-leaves-some-independent-media-in-the-lurch/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them a week’s notice on the shutdown. Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.</p>

  <p>A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting all of these “build your own platform” arguments aside, this move should have a serious impact on Medium’s credibility—not just as a service or a platform—but as a company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).</p>
  
  <p>An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.</p>

  <p>Inmates in solitary confinement at Snake River spend 23 hours a day in cells with no windows to the outside world; their outside-the-cell time is spent in a concrete-enclosed exercise room.</p>
  
  <p>But during the course of Nadkarni’s one-year study, half of the 48 prisoners in a solitary cellblock got to watch nature videos of their choosing projected on a wall in the room during the 45 to 60 minutes they spent there each day.</p>
  
  <p>The videos projected in what inmates called the &ldquo;blue room&rdquo; included imagery of forests, beaches, and Earth viewed from space. Inmates in the other half of the cellblock took their exercise time as usual, without being exposed to any nature videos.</p>
  
  <p>What happened? According to surveys and interviews conducted at the conclusion of the study, 43 percent of the inmates who were allowed to watch the nature videos said the videos soothed them. “When I first went into the blue room, I was like ‘wow, how beautiful this world is,’” one of the inmates said.</p>

<p>Even worse, the Post says no evacuation order was issued in Houston. That’ll raise questions about the city’s storm preps, but save that for later. This event is expected to play out over the next several days, and it looks progressively dire as it develops.</p>

  <p>First, Like and Retweet counts update dynamically, so you can see instantly the engagement generated by a tweet.</p>
  
  <p>Second, you can add filters and stickers to your profile photo.</p>
  
  <p>Third, and most welcome of all, links now open in Safari instead of Twitter’s own browser. This means that you’re now logged into websites where you have an account. It also provides access to Reader View.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks a lot better than the previous app, and I can&rsquo;t believe it took so long to implement Safari View Controller. Still, there&rsquo;s a lot of text everywhere all the time, and it remains too hard to access lists, which I use now more than ever.</p>

<p>Both Tweetbot and Twitteriffic allow me to set tabs at the bottom of the screen for quick access feeds dedicated to news, soccer, tech and automotive news. For example, this allows me to keep the minute-to-minute noise of the news cycle outside of my main feed, yet it&rsquo;s always available the second I want to dive in. List support adds a remarkable layer of depth to the Twitter experience, and the service is significantly less useful without it.</p>

<p>I adore my iPhone SE. I upgraded from a 6 Plus, and despite the massive change is screen size, I quickly adjusted to the SE thanks to it&rsquo;s perfect form factor. Despite lacking some high-level features, it&rsquo;s simply remarkable how powerful and capable this phone is at the price point. It&rsquo;s easily my favorite iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple may be on it&rsquo;s way to creating it&rsquo;s next all-time greatest phone, but it&rsquo;s going to have to do serious work if it wants to beat the SE.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products — effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.</p>
  
  <p>Today, more than half the nation’s primary- and secondary-school students — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America’s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.</p>
  
  <p>“Between the fall of 2012 and now, Google went from an interesting possibility to the dominant way that schools around the country” teach students to find information, create documents and turn them in, said Hal Friedlander, former chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education, the nation’s largest school district. “Google established itself as a fact in schools.”</p>

  <p>The tech giants, who are increasingly competing for customers’ time, eyeballs and money, are close to an agreement to bring an Amazon video app to Apple’s Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the two companies.</p>
  
  <p>Amazon employees expect the app to show up on Apple’s hardware in the third quarter of the year.</p>
  
  <p>That move would allow Amazon Prime Video subscribers to easily watch TV shows and movies from the service using Apple TV.</p>
  
  <p>For the past few years, Amazon subscribers have only been able to watch their shows on Apple TV using Apple’s comparatively cumbersome Airplay system, which involves connecting another Apple product, like an iPhone, to an Apple TV using a Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV won the battle for my living room last year thanks to a very nice Playstation Vue app along with the access to Prime video content. The Apple TV was relegated to the bedroom TV, but in that time it&rsquo;s added a solid Vue (though it&rsquo;s hampered a bit by Apple&rsquo;s remote).</p>

<p>With the addition of Amazon Video, the Apple TV may get a run at my living room again.

  <p>But! Wait! There&rsquo;s a bunch of things wrong with this Trump tweet.
  The most obvious is that the media didn&rsquo;t create the idea of the first 100 days as an important moment, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did. Roosevelt saw the first 100 days of his term in 1933 as an absolutely essential moment to re-build momentum and optimism in a country that was still reeling from the Great Depression.

  <p>“Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’” Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. “Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.” And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.</p>
  
  <p>“And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?” Mr. Ballmer continued. “Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.”</p>
  
  <p>Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste suddenly start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.</p>

  <p>“We’ve given up. It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed,” Brodie said. “Even though we’ve spent a lot of money, we’ve had no success.”</p>
  
  <p>Brodie used strong language to describe the threats to the reef in 2017. He said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated.</p>
  
  <p>“Last year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,” Brodie said. “The federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programs, the water quality management is having very limited success. It’s unsuccessful.”</p>

  <p>Similar to what has been offered by third-party Twitter clients for sometime, users will be able to hide tweets from specific users or tweets that contain certain keywords from ever appearing in their timeline …</p>
  
  <p>The Twitter app added muting features for notifications at the end of last year. It will shortly roll out the same capabilities to the home timeline.</p>
  
  <p>The Twitter app will also include options to hide users that don’t have a profile photo, cutting down abuse from so-called ‘egg accounts’ which typically retain anonymity by using the default Twitter profile pictures. There will also be settings to mute accounts that use unverified contact information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solar industry is more labor intensive than other types of energy. Even though it still represents only a tiny fraction of energy production overall—less than 2%—it already has more workers than natural gas, coal, wind, and nuclear. The use of robots and other automation may make solar work more efficient, but jobs will still continue to grow.</p>
  
  <p>By 2021, by some calculations, the U.S. may have 100 gigawatts of installed capacity; right now, we&rsquo;re close to 39 gigawatts. One national study estimated that the country had the capacity for two terawatts of solar power—or 200,000 gigawatts.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even come close to scratching the surface,&rdquo; Luecke says. &ldquo;We still are only 1.3% of the overall electricity mix. I think the rooftops in our land can support a tremendous amount of more solar development.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The officials said that Priebus&rsquo; Feb. 15 request to FBI Director James Comey and deputy director Andrew McCabe came as the White House sought to discredit a New York Times report about contacts between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump&rsquo;s 2016 campaign team.</p>

  <p>Washington (CNN)The FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump&rsquo;s associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign, multiple US officials briefed on the matter tell CNN.</p>
  
  <p>But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was only made after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate.
  White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14.</p>

  <p>Astronomers have found a nearby solar system with seven Earth-sized planets, three of which circle their parent star at the right distance for liquid surface water, raising the prospect of life, research published on Wednesday showed.</p>
  
  <p>The star, known as TRAPPIST-1, is a small, dim celestial body in the constellation Aquarius. It is located about 40 light years away from Earth. Researchers said the proximity of the system, combined with the proportionally large size of its planets compared to the small star, make it a good target for follow-up studies. They hope to scan the planets&rsquo; atmospheres for possible chemical fingerprints of life.</p>

  <p>The judge made the most high-profile ruling of his tenure Friday when he temporarily invalidated Trump’s ban on travel to the U.S. from seven primarily Muslim nations. Washington state sued to block the order - with support from Minnesota and major corporations including Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia - arguing that it’s unconstitutional and would harm its residents, and Robart held that the state was likely correct.</p>

      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/29/donald-trump-is-an-economic-nationalist-whats-an-economic-nationalist/?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.429e2e4f5849">The 35% tariff and history </a><br/><p>Jeff Colgan at The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Trump foreign economic plan most closely resembles President Herbert Hoover’s “mercantilist” approach, which tried to deal with the 1929 crash of the U.S. economy by protecting U.S. industry from foreign competition (and Mexican immigrants). The Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 dramatically increased U.S. tariffs on imports, thereby hurting America’s trade partners. Those countries, especially the European ones, responded with trade tariffs of their own. The resulting trade war worsened economic problems, produced the Great Depression, and paved the way for Nazis in Germany. If Trump’s “close the borders” approach led to trade wars with China and others that were even half as nasty as those of the 1930s, the world would be immeasurably worse off.&ldquo;</p>

<p>This was a very interesting read. Excellent analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to background material provided in a university news release, psychological treatments are effective in the short term in about 70 percent of adolescents with depression. But it’s not clear how these patients fare in the long term, the study authors noted.</p>
  
  <p>The study included 465 teens in England who had been diagnosed with depression.</p>
  
  <p>The participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: cognitive behavior therapy (focusing on changing how people think); short-term psychoanalytic therapy (focusing on topics like dreams, memories and the unconscious); or a brief psychosocial intervention (focusing on strategies like encouraging pleasurable activities and combating loneliness).</p>
  
  <p>The researchers found that 70 percent of the teens improved to a significant extent no matter which approach they tried. In those who benefited from treatment, their depression symptoms had declined by 50 percent over the next year.</p>

      <p>The world football community is showing overwhelming support for those killed in the the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38166925" target="_blank">tragic plane crash</a> in Columbia. The crash claimed the lives of 71 people, including players and staff from Brazilian club Chapecoense and reports from FOX News.</p>

<p>Zito Madu from SB Nation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapecoense was a team from the small industrial city of Chapeco in Southern Brazil, inhabited by 210,000 people; they were headed to Colombia to play against Atlético Nacional in the Copa Sudamericana final. They had beaten well-renowned teams like Independiente and San Lorenzo on their journey. They made the quarterfinals in the previous season, which then was considered a surprise, and this year was to be their Cinderella story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of competing for the Copa Sudemericana trophy, Nacional asked that it be rewarded to Chapecoense.</p>

<p>Atletico Mineiro was set to play Chapecoense in the final game of the year for the Brazilian league, but it instead decided to forfeit it&rsquo;s the match. Instead, thousands crowded the stadium in honor of the lives lost in the crash:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is upgrading its mute feature — instead of just allowing users to mute accounts they don&rsquo;t want to see tweets from, now users can mute words, phrases and notifications. That means instead of getting a notification when you&rsquo;re mentioned in a hateful conversation, there&rsquo;s no indication it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
  
  <p>To prevent those abusive comments from being posted in the first place, Twitter is upgrading its tools to allow users to directly report different types of conduct that violates Twitter&rsquo;s policies — anything that specifically &ldquo;targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>More specific reporting will make it easier for Twitter to process complaints faster, and more quickly help the person experiencing the abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating that Twitter is implementing these changes <em>after</em> the election. CEO Jack Dorsey said the company was looking into changes <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/26/jack-dorsey-on-twitters-harassment-problem-abuse-is-not-part-of-civil-discourse/" target="_blank">months ago</a>.

It was Valentine’s Day, maybe ten years ago.</p><p>We were lined up outside. We’d never been to one of his shows, and we were surrounded by the folks who’d gotten tickets through his fan club.</p><p>There was this tall guy, six six, maybe. Thin. Black, maybe forty something. Dressed in this wild outfit.</p><p>And he was walking down the line. And every person in line he’d stop, give them a rose, and tell them that he loved them.</p><p>I struggled to figure it out for a minute. Like: did this guy work for the promoter? Was it like getting a bobblehead at a baseball game? He didn’t look high. He didn’t seem crazy. He didn’t want money. He didn’t seem to want anything.</p><p>And by the time he got to us, it made sense to me. </p><p>This was just a guy who wanted to share a feeling. Just share something beautiful with each person. Tell each person he loved them, as they were.</p><p>Look: Prince might have been the greatest pop musician of the last fifty years. He found #1 hits on his garbage pile and played every instrument and synthesized genres and danced his rear off and all of that stuff.</p><p>But it’s not just that music. What he left was an idea and an example. He was this skinny, short, shy, fey black kid from a rough neighborhood. And he lived in an America where there were all of these cultural expectations of him, All these ideas based on all of that. And he didn’t reject the categories people wanted to put him in. He transcended them. Made them completely irrelevant.</p><p>It wasn’t oppositional. It wasn’t negative. Prince said it, pretty simply. I am me. I am doing my thing. </p><p>And he invited everyone to come visit Paisley Park and do theirs.</p><p>And so when I think of his leaving, I think of the people whose lives he helped define. I think of kids backed into corners in 1980s America. By circumstance of society or birth or whatever. Weird kids and queer kids and kids who were bad at doing whatever it was that was expected of them.</p><p>Prince didn’t show them to be Prince. He showed them they could be themselves. That they could live without apology. Love defiantly.</p><p>Prince gave them a rose.</p></blockquote>

<p>So for $50 you can get two-day shipping from Wal-Mart, or pay Amazon $100 for what may be a wider selection, plus movies, TV, music, unlimited photo storage and Kindle books.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good first step for Wal-Mart, and you could argue that some customers don&rsquo;t want all the extra stuff that Amazon offers with Prime. Still feels like Wal-Mart has a long way to go and a short time to get there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as I don’t have time for podcasts, I don’t have time to read about a new app for 30 minutes when I could try it for myself in 5 minutes. It makes no sense to read these beastly posts when I could do the work the reviewer was supposed to do — but in less time than I would spend reading the review.</p>
  
  <p>Apps, bags, knives, devices — none of those need more than a thousand or two thousand words at most. Anything more than that is poor writing, and even poorer reviewing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a full app review in a long time. Most are lengthy deep-dives into an app that shows some signs of promise, but has little hope of reaching its potential.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a certain craft to writing such long reviews, but I simply don&rsquo;t have the time or the attention cache to put towards them.</p>

<p>I like Ben&rsquo;s idea of capping off reviews, but I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far. A review needs to be as long as it needs to be. But I would prefer that the reviews get to the point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, having a feed that users willingly return to day-after-day is the foundation of successful mobile advertising companies, especially Facebook. As I noted back in 2013 the feed allows for an advertising unit that is actually superior to anything found on the desktop: users have no choice but to at least visually engage with whatever is dominating the screen of the mobile device that is the center of their lives.</p>
  
  <p>In fact, I would argue that the feed is so important that its development — or lack thereof — is the core reason why Facebook has soared over the last ten years, while Twitter has slumped after a beginning that suggested the exact opposite sort of outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still use Twitter more than Facebook, but I&rsquo;ve slowly started adding Facebook back into my daily reading experience. Doing so required using the News Feed similarly to how I use Twitter.</p>

<p>That meant unfollowing basically everyone and then hitting the &ldquo;like&rdquo; button on feeds that I&rsquo;m interested in; websites, bands, brands and people I actually like.</p>

<p>Now I have a news feed that&rsquo;s actually a &ldquo;News Feed.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more closely tailored to things I&rsquo;m interested in while supplementing my Twitter use quite well. Sometimes it&rsquo;s even better.</p>

  <p>None of that stopped Minecraft: Pocket Edition 2 from skyrocketing to #4 on iTunes’ paid app chart, as redditors on r/games discovered late last night. Although the game is no longer on top of the charts, it remains on iTunes, where you can find the same scammer selling other games too.</p>

  <p>Windows 10 had 9.00 percent market share in November, and gained 0.96 percentage points to hit 9.96 percent in December.

In December, that figure was less than 1 point. This year, Microsoft will be attempting to counter that slowdown, starting with making Windows 10 a “recommended update” so that Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users are more likely to install it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you like Castro, please consider becoming a patron by contributing $1/month. You will support the work of a small indie app studio in a way that the standard App Store model never can. Yesterday, Supertop needed an endless stream of thousands of new customers to sustain our business. From today, we can be successful with a far smaller number of much happier customers. We can offer better support. We can add new features more often, instead of holding them back for splashy major releases. In other words, we can do the things that indies do best.</p>

<p>This move mirrors <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing" target="_blank">Marco Arment&rsquo;s</a> approach with Overcast.

<blockquote>
  <p>Arguably, the most “heartwarming” of the staged spectacles, the surprise homecomings in which a husband and wife are re-united after a separation, can also be the most misleading. One recent example, replayed millions of times across social media, showed a Marine officer returning from South Korea to the loving embrace of his cheerleader wife during halftime at a professional football game, as the crowd roared in approval. No one should begrudge the couple their well-deserved moment of joy. It was great to see. But these scenes can also present a deceptively saccharine vision of war that invites the crowd to stand and stretch, clap for a few seconds, and return to their drinks and the game with a smile, reassured that everything seems right with the world. By pumping out such romanticized images of homecoming – which are then shared through retweets and posts on Facebook across the country — do we not run the risk of sanitizing the reality of many homecomings that are not the stuff of Hollywood?</p>
  
  <p>When I saw this, I couldn’t help but imagine what it would have been like if, instead, the Jumbotron had carried live footage of a military “casualty notification” officer in his dress uniform approaching the door of a comfortable home in middle America, stepping across a carefully manicured lawn, knocking on the door, an American flag blowing lazily in the breeze overhead, and having a mother collapse in tears at the sight of him, before he even has a chance to tell her that her only son had been shot and killed in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve grown more and more troubled by such displays. I was mostly aggravated by the fact that a partner or child was lied to just so their family could get a cute story that would go viral, but Bardenwerper’s reasoning cuts deeper.</p>

  <p>Senate investigators report that the Department of Defense has spent more than $9 million over the last four years on military tributes at sporting events, carefully staged patriotic displays meant to drum up goodwill and recruiting that weren’t publicly disclosed as paid advertisements.</p>
  
  <p>If you’ve gone to games or watched TV, you’ve been exposed to these ads. They take familiar forms: giant American flags, military-family reunions, the singing of “God Bless America” at baseball games, even things as seemingly minor as showing troops on the jumbotron for a round of applause. Sen. Jeff Flake revealed the practice earlier this year, and now Flake and fellow Arizona Republican John McCain have obtained 122 different contracts between the Pentagon and individual teams and leagues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s Google’s turn now. The Alphabet company is getting ready to open a dedicated home for podcasts on its Google Play hub. Today the company is letting podcast creators upload shows to Google Play Music, its streaming service; it says listeners will be able to listen to those shows “in the coming months.” It will be, remarkably, the first native app for podcast listening on Android in the content market where Apple carries disproportionate weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement comes over 10 years after Apple added the medium to iTunes. John Gruber has <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/10/27/google-podcasts" target="_blank">already pointed out</a> pointed out Marco Arment&rsquo;s post from two weeks ago, in which he declared <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing" target="_blank">&ldquo;Big money is coming.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>I can only guess that both Arment and Gruber were referring to this all along. Also, Arment retweeted this:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I bet the same people who were arguing that Overcast 2.0 is anti-competitive will be oddly silent about this <a href="https://t.co/wYZI5ZW7Jf" target="_blank">https://t.co/wYZI5ZW7Jf</a>…</p>— ATP Tipster (@ATP_Tipster1) <a href="https://twitter.com/ATP_Tipster1/status/659068546006306816" target="_blank">October 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>Hypothetically, I&rsquo;m not sure the implementation of podcasts to Google Play would have made a significant impact on his audience if he kept his original pricing model. It is, after all, bolstered by his previous work and his high-profile <a href="http://atp.fm" target="_blank">podcast</a> and <a href="http://marco.org" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t argue with the potential that Google&rsquo;s announcement has on, say, a newer developer trying to make a podcast app. Their efforts are already bolstered by <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/10/podcasters-welcome-to-google-play-music.html" target="_blank">heavy hitters in the podcasting world</a> like 5by5, Nerdist and over a dozen more. On the other hand, Google is still getting into the game 10 years behind Apple.</p>

<p>Like the above tweet, the announcement can easily be used as a way to confirm Arment&rsquo;s place in the <a href="http://samanthabielefeld.com/the-elephant-in-the-room" target="_blank">big argument here</a>, but I think it goes beyond podcast apps, and thus is still an argument worth having.</p>

  <p>A group of 22 scientists reviewed the evidence linking red meat and processed meat consumption to cancer, and concluded that eating processed meats regularly increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Their evidence review is explained in an article published in The Lancet.</p>
  
  <p>The conclusion puts processed meats in the same category of cancer risk as tobacco smoking and asbestos. This does not mean that they are equally dangerous, says the International Agency for Research on Cancer — the agency within the WHO that sets the classifications. And it&rsquo;s important to note that even things such as aloe vera are on the list of possible carcinogens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m nearly 40 years old and I have a six-year medical degree, a BSc, an MD and membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. I also have two children, debts which make me sick with worry each month, a marriage which is likely over and a good going stomach ulcer. I work part-time but that involves a 100-mile round trip, three-hour commute and being away from my children for 48 hours every week because I can’t afford to live close enough to the hospital. I work 60 hours a week in order to make my part-time arrangement work.</p>
  
  <p>I can’t afford to attend the conferences and courses I need to in order to make consultant. I can’t afford the last exam I need to do. I can’t afford my General Medical Council fees, my medical defence insurance or my membership of the Royal College of Surgeons that I worked so hard to earn. I can’t afford the petrol to drive to work each day.</p>
  
  <p>This year I have been screamed at, spat at and kicked. I have physically removed excrement from someone who needed that help. I have cut off people’s legs. I have told people that the most important person in the world to them is dying. I have told people that they are dying. I have told a woman her child may not survive. I have not eaten or drunk anything over a 13-hour period more times than I can remember. This year, once a week, I have woken up on the floor cold, jittery, anxious, hungry and traumatised by the things I have seen and the things I have had to do.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/10/15/please-do-not-be-cynical.html">"Please do not be cynical"</a></h1>

      <p>Samantha Bielefeld published <a href="http://samanthabielefeld.com/journal/the-elephant-in-the-room" target="_blank">a blog post</a> Wednesday morning that really fired up people in the developer community. There was plenty of healthy debate to be had throughout the day, but there was also far too much unhealthy cynicism thrown around via Twitter.</p>

<p>Bielefeld&rsquo;s argument centered on Marco Arment&rsquo;s explanation over why he changed the pricing model of his podcast app, <a href="https://overcast.fm" target="_blank">Overcast</a>, and whether such a strategy would benefit the average developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The typical programmer doesn&rsquo;t have a popular website with ad placements, or a successful podcast that earns them tens, and tens of thousands of dollars a year. I&rsquo;m not knocking his success, he has put effort into his line of work, and has built his own life. He can afford to gamble the potential for Overcast to provide him income. But it most certainly is not the norm. Few app developers are able to enjoy the launch day success that comes from having major sites like iMore, Macworld, MacStories, and 9to5Mac all launch reviews of their app in unison on the day of release. The result is a chart topping, traffic driving experience that results in even more downloads than the people who follow his work would provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bielefeld&rsquo;s overall point was mostly lost in the outrage of her calculating of possible ad revenue from Arment&rsquo;s podcast, <a href="https://atp.fm" target="_blank">The Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Updated my post to fix an error: Marco makes $208,000 a year from ATP, not $70,000.

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>What followed was a disappointingly cynical exchange between countless people on Twitter. Arment certainly took offense to Bielefeld&rsquo;s piece:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was going to write a response to the resentful, misinformed people trying to count my money and misattribute my success, but why bother?</p>— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/654375332540194816" target="_blank">October 14, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>Even Federico Viticci got in on the fun:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Weird.

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>Bielefeld ultimately <a href="https://twitter.com/s_bielefeld/status/654356582243807232" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> the mistake and removed the information about ad revenue with hopes of bringing focus back to her central argument. Yet, countless people were incapable of finding a way to discuss the issue respectfully.</p>

<p>I find the following tweet from Arment to be particularly disappointing. Bielefeld pointed out that the title of her piece, &ldquo;The Elephant in the Room,&rdquo; alluded to remarks made by Phil Schiller about Arment on an episode of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123" target="_blank">The Talk Show</a>. Marco&rsquo;s response:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/s_bielefeld" target="_blank">@s_bielefeld</a> Yup, before you existed! <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBradley" target="_blank">@EricBradley</a></p>— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/654378848881143808" target="_blank">October 14, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>I tried to get involved in the debate in a way that was civil and respectful. To Arment&rsquo;s credit, he <a href="https://twitter.com/codyatucker/status/654385978061258752" target="_blank">responded to my tweets</a> and our exchange was pleasant. He helped me understand his point of view honestly and <em>without</em> cynicism.</p>

<p>Since posting her article, Bielefeld has been answering a flood of complaints and encouragement on Twitter. She&rsquo;s even mentioned the possibility of ceasing publication of her website in the wake of the uproar. She says she still has over a thousand emails to sift through on topic. I fear that many of them are as cynical as many of the responses on Twitter, but they may even be worse. I&rsquo;m certainly not above posting cynical comments on Twitter. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve done it before, but I feel like things really got out of hand on Wednesday.</p>

<p>This all reminds me of the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. His comments at the end of the show were poignant and refreshing. I&rsquo;ve tried to remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_X4w8FdGk" target="_blank">this passage of his speech</a> ever since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it&rsquo;s my least favorite quality and it doesn&rsquo;t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you&rsquo;re kind, amazing things will happen. I&rsquo;m telling you, amazing things will happen.</p>

  <p>In 2011, several citizen scientists flagged one particular star as “interesting” and “bizarre.” The star was emitting a light pattern that looked stranger than any of the others Kepler was watching.</p>
  
  <p>The light pattern suggests there is a big mess of matter circling the star, in tight formation. That would be expected if the star were young. When our solar system first formed, four and a half billion years ago, a messy disk of dust and debris surrounded the sun, before gravity organized it into planets, and rings of rock and ice.</p>
  
  <p>But this unusual star isn’t young. If it were young, it would be surrounded by dust that would give off extra infrared light. There doesn’t seem to be an excess of infrared light around this star.</p>

And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.</p>
  
  <p>So we have made an extremely tough decision: we plan to part ways with up to 336 people from across the company. We are doing this with the utmost respect for each and every person. Twitter will go to great lengths to take care of each individual by providing generous exit packages and help finding a new job.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a tough call to make. I hope Twitter pulls through in helping all of those laid off today.</p>

<p>In Jason Snell&rsquo;s review for <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2991920/hardware/imac-with-4k-retina-display-review-a-high-resolution-desktop-mac-for-the-masses.html" target="_blank">Macworld</a>, he argues that you should go with the Fusion Drive over the base 5400rpm drive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base storage configuration of the 4K iMac is a 1TB, 5400rpm hard drive. It’s been a few years since I regularly used a Mac with a spinning disk as its primary hard drive, and man, did it feel slow. Starting up was slow. Launching apps was slow. Everything&hellip; just&hellip; took&hellip; longer. It’s disconcerting to take a brand-new, top-of-its-line Mac out of the box and be disappointed by how sluggish it feels, but that’s what I experienced, and it’s pretty much down to that slow hard drive.</p>

<p>Apple also announced the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2. <a href="http://www.apple.com/magic-accessories/" target="_blank">The trio of devices</a> all come with a built in lithium-ion battery that charge via Apple&rsquo;s standard lightning cable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most intrigued by the Magic Trackpad 2, as it would replace the original unit that I&rsquo;ve been using since 2011. It also comes with the Force Touch technology that&rsquo;s built in to many of Apple&rsquo;s notebooks, which adds a whole new depth of interaction to OS X. The Magic Keyboard looks fantastic, but it doesn&rsquo;t feature Apple&rsquo;s new key switches that comes with the Macbook.</p>

  <p>Jack Dorsey has announced that he is re-taking the reins of the social network that he helped build. Dorsey had been the interim CEO since it was announced that previous CEO Dick Costolo was stepping down in June of this year. Twitter created a search committee after Costolo&rsquo;s departure that included former Twitter CEO, Evan Williams, to find a new boss. Turns out that the figure was there, all the time. In addition, Dorsey will remain as CEO of Square, the mobile-payments firm he founded when he left Twitter. This will be Dorsey&rsquo;s second term as CEO, the first abruptly ending in 2008 when he was replaced as CEO by Ev Williams.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He no longer sits silently in meetings — current colleagues say he provides the kind of direct, constructive feedback you’d expect from someone with Dorsey’s reputation as a product guru. There’s still some fear that Dorsey will send people packing, but the chip on his shoulder appears to be gone. Even Twitter co-founder and good friend Biz Stone said something has changed with his friend in the last few years at Square.</p>
  
  <p>“I feel like he went into a time chamber and studied for 40 years and came out after one,” Stone said. “It’s like, what happened? Where did you get all this confidence and great answers and specificity? He seems to be much deeper now. It’s like talking to a much older person.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A central issue in Mrs. Clinton’s proposals are the background checks on prospective gun buyers, which are required for retailers at stores. But under federal law, they are not required at gun shows or over the Internet with private sellers.</p>
  
  <p>Under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, she would use administrative powers to make anyone selling a substantial number of guns declared “in the business” of firearms dealing, and subject to the same rules as retailers, if Congress does not act, according to the campaign aide.</p>
  
  <p>It was not immediately clear what the bar for being declared “in the business” would be. And use of executive action in connection with guns is certain to face criticism from staunch supporters of the Second Amendment. It is also likely to be applauded by Democrats who have grown weary of gridlock in Congress.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We had our suspicions, based in part on Apple patent filings in one particular area: waterproofing. Apple has been investigating a waterproof (or, more accurately, liquid proof) iPhone for at least the last several years. If that strip of sticky goop on the 6s wasn’t put there to hold the display in, then maybe—just maybe—it was designed to keep liquids out. Like a gasket!</p>
  
  <p>Of course, that was only a theory. But over the weekend some brave Apple fans introduced their new iPhones to a life aquatic. The phones didn’t always emerge unscathed, but the overall trend is clear: the 6s and 6s Plus are dramatically less prone to liquid damage than their predecessors. (They aren’t, of course, completely waterproof—so don’t jump into a pool with them or anything.)</p>

  <p>Taking a rostrum never before occupied by the bishop of Rome, the pontiff issued a vigorous call to action on issues largely favored by liberals, including a powerful defense of immigration, a critique of the excesses of capitalism, an endorsement of environmental legislation, a blistering condemnation of the arms trade and a plea to abolish the death penalty.</p>

      <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">Marco Arment drops top-selling iOS content blocker, Peace</a><br/><p>Just two days after releasing perhaps the best iOS content blocker, Peace, Marco Arment has pulled it from the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good, which I didn’t anticipate, but probably should have. Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.</p>
  
  <p>Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. This approach is too blunt, and Ghostery and I have both decided that it doesn’t serve our goals or beliefs well enough. If we’re going to effect positive change overall, a more nuanced, complex approach is required than what I can bring in a simple iOS app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arguments over the positives and negatives of iOS content blockers are a hot mess. See <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web" target="_blank">this piece by Nilay Patel</a>, but I think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/because-of-apple" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> is right when it comes to the affect content blockers will have on smaller outlets.</p>

<p>Back to Marco: Peace was built on <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/" target="_blank">a very strong platform built by Ghostery</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t editable like Ghostery&rsquo;s desktop counterpart. You could go in a whitelist individual sites to allow ads from those you trust. That&rsquo;s something you should definitely consider doing in other iOS content blockers.</p>

<p>Marco ultimately decided it&rsquo;s best to just get out of the storm before it gets worse, and it most certainly will. He deserves a great deal of respect for that.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2015/09/10/apples-iphone-upgrade-program.html">Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program</a></h1>

      <a href="http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/9/10/applecare-more-expensive-for-iphone-6s6s-plus">Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program</a><br/><p>Yesterday, Apple announced the <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program" target="_blank">Apple Upgrade Program</a>, and it sounds pretty great:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone Upgrade Program gives you an easier way to get a new iPhone every year, and the security and protection of AppleCare+. You’re even free to choose the carrier and rate plan that work for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best part of the deal is that you can trade in your phone for the new model after 12 installments. Back to Apple&rsquo;s promo page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After 12 installments, you can get a new iPhone and start a new iPhone Upgrade Program. No more waiting for your carrier contract to end. Just trade in your current iPhone for a new one, and your new program begins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 64GB iPhone 6S Plus will cost you $40.75/mo. on the Apple Upgrade Program before you tack on carrier fees. For comparison, my iPhone 6 Plus costs me 35.38/mo. In total, the 6S Plus would cost $978 after 24 months compared to $849.12 for my iPhone 6. The price difference comes out to $128.88, which just so happens to be the newly increased price of <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/APP_IPHONE_6S_PLUS_AUTO-133580/applecare-for-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus" target="_blank">AppleCare+ for iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>So just going on price alone, you&rsquo;re not saving any money by going straight to the Apple Store to buy your iPhone. But remember what you get:</p>

<ul><li>Brand new iPhone</li>
<li>AppleCare+ included</li>
<li>Pick any carrier you want at the time of purchase</li>
<li>After 12 months, you can trade up to the new iPhone</li>
</ul><p>With ATT, I got a new phone with that Next 18 contract and then had to go buy AppleCare+. That&rsquo;s not a huge deal, but I first had to decline AT&amp;T&rsquo;s insurance plan by a pushy salesperson.</p>

<p>Given the time I purchased the phone, my contract ends on December 28, 2016 while my upgrade eligibility date is July 30, 2016. To upgrade to an iPhone 6 Plus right now, I would first have to pay AT&amp;T over $300.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible that I could trade in my iPhone at Best Buy or a similar outlet and upgrade to the new device, but I&rsquo;m not sure how the pricing would work out. Apple&rsquo;s Upgrade Program eliminates all of that hassle. Customers can now walk into any Apple store and pick up the phone along with everything they need, all while knowing they can upgrade to the newest phone in 12 months. The simplicity alone is good enough for me.</p>

Yet, they&rsquo;ve already taken in 1.5 million refugees as part of the mass exodus of people fleeing their war-torn homes across the middle east.</p>

<p>Despite the massive influx of people, there appear to be no riots or protests to what is now an overwhelming humanitarian effort. Steffen Huck writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a near-miracle that the situation has not led to riots, or protests at the very least. It is also a miracle that this very fact has drawn little attention from the Western public. Not that the West is ignoring the region itself, but reports are dominated by the horrors of Islamist terrorism. Whenever pillars fall, world heritage sites are destroyed, and another bestial murder is committed by &ldquo;Daesh&rdquo; (otherwise known as ISIS, or ISIL or IS), everyone&rsquo;s eyes are on the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
  
  <p>This focus on bad news leads to a sadly distorted picture of the Arab region and its dominant religion, which causes all 1.6 billion followers of Islam worldwide to suffer. Hardly any of our Arab friends in Jordan are without a specific story to contribute in this respect: they get evil looks from fellow flyers at the airport gate, are grilled by border control officials, and on entry to Israel they even have to take off the baby&rsquo;s nappy so the guards can make sure there are no explosives hidden inside.</p>

  <p>Wednesday night&rsquo;s blasts, so large that they were seen by satellites in space, sent shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away in the port city of 15 million people. Internet videos showed fireballs shooting into the sky and the U.S. Geological Survey registered the blasts as seismic events.</p>
  
  <p>Vast areas of the port - the 10th largest in the world - were devastated, crumpled shipping containers were thrown around like match sticks, hundreds of new cars were torched and port buildings left as burnt-out shells, Reuters witnesses said.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;I was sleeping when our windows and doors suddenly shook as we heard explosions outside. I first thought it was an earthquake,&rdquo; Guan Xiang, who lives 7 km (4 miles) away from the explosion site, told Reuters by telephone.</p>

  <p>If the outcry over the killing of Cecil the lion tells us anything, it’s that people are capable of genuine moral outrage at the needless killing of animals. And good for them.

  <p>But in a given year, the typical American will cause the death of 30 land animals, and 28 chickens, by eating meat.

</blockquote>

<p>The frustration over the killing of Cecil is perfectly acceptable to a certain degree (I’m awfully sad about it), but don’t you dare follow up your protest by picking up a McChicken at the drive thru.</p></blockquote>

<p>Entire businesses plan, prepare and execute the action of torturing thousands upon thousands of chicken. Fast food in this country is popular because of its accessibility and affordability. I’m not saying it’s right what happens to chickens, but don’t slander what feeds thousands of middle class to lower class citizens and tell them they can’t care about a national symbol of natures beauty and integrity because of it. Pointing fingers doesn’t solve problems.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a curious direction to take the argument, but I&rsquo;ll bite.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in my post that spoke against the necessity of the accessible and affordable food. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s something we can easily agree on. Nevertheless, there are surely affordable food options that aren&rsquo;t derived from the grotesque torture of animals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still important to remind people of the moral implications of a variety of food options out there. That&rsquo;s what Matthews&rsquo; piece in regards to the killing of Cecil the Lion did so well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look, if any job is going to take up someone’s life, it deserves a living wage. If a job exists and you have to hire someone to do it, they deserve a living wage. End of story. There’s a lot of talk going around my workplace along the lines of, “These guys with no education and no skills think they deserve as much as us? Fuck those guys.” And elsewhere on FB: “I’m a licensed electrician, I make $13/hr, fuck these burger flippers.”</p>
  
  <p>And that’s exactly what the bosses want! They want us fighting over who has the bigger pile of crumbs so we don’t realize they made off with almost the whole damn cake. Why are you angry about fast food workers making two bucks more an hour when your CEO makes four hundred TIMES what you do? It’s in the bosses’ interests to keep your anger directed downward, at the poor people who are just trying to get by, like you, rather than at the rich assholes who consume almost everything we produce and give next to nothing for it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If long prison sentences was truly a deterrent, juveniles would stop committing crimes when they turn 18 and face the possibility of more jail time. But they don’t. There are several reasons why: First, criminals, who are often young men, tend to be impulsive and to discount the future. The possibility of a longer prison sentence is too far away to pose as a deterrent. Second, even after they turn 18, there’s still a fair amount of uncertainty around the length of their sentence. The Harris County data show jail time often depends on the judge that’s assigned, the prosecutor, available evidence, and how busy the court is, which determines the odds that someone convicted ends up with a plea bargain. Longer sentences aren’t much of a deterrent because, even in our era of mass incarceration, the possibility of actually going to prison is too uncertain and too far in the future to meaningfully impact behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DURANT, Okla. (AP) — Calling the Internet a 21st century necessity, President Barack Obama on Wednesday unveiled a program to bring faster Internet connections to more low-income households, particularly to help students living in public and assisted housing stay ahead in school.</p>
  
  <p>Under ConnectHome, the public, private and nonprofit sectors have pledged to work together to provide high-speed connections and digital devices to more families at lower cost.</p>
  
  <p>More than 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate have Internet access, Obama said. But fewer than half of low-income households have similar access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent move to frame it primarily as an education issue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ConnectHome is similar to ConnectEd, a federal program that Obama said is on track to wire 99 percent of K-12 classrooms and libraries with high-speed Internet by the end of 2017.</p>
  
  <p>ConnectHome will begin in 27 cities and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Durant. With about 200,000 members spread across much of southeastern Oklahoma, the Choctaw Nation is the nation&rsquo;s third-largest Native American tribe.</p>
  
  <p>The Choctaw Nation was also among the administration&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Promise Zones,&rdquo; a designation that makes it eligible for tax incentives and grants to help fight poverty.</p>
  
  <p>The only federal money expected to be spent on ConnectHome is a $50,000 Agriculture Department grant to the Choctaw Nation, officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifty-two senators voted for an amendment Tuesday to ban discrimination against LGBT students in public schools, but the measure to amend the Every Child Achieves Act failed because 60 votes were required for passage.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m tremendously disappointed in the Senate,” Sen. Al Franken, who sponsored the amendment, said in a statement after the vote. “The inability to put in place meaningful protections for some of our most vulnerable children is an enormous disservice to LGBT students all across the country who face terrible bullying every day.”</p>

<p>&gt;Iwata was an enormous force not just at Nintendo, but in gaming. He led Nintendo through the eras of the GameCube, Wii, DS, 3DS, and Wii U, and he worked on Earthbound, Pokemon, Kirby, The Legend of Zelda, Smash Bros., and countless other titles. These are consoles and games that filled my childhood with joy, which I spent literally thousands of hours playing. The games alone account for some of the biggest successes in the industry, and many of their sequels continue to entertain millions of people around the world.</p>

<p>I was 18 or 19 when I finally got around to the GameCube. Later on I got a Wii, which left me tons of memories thanks to games like Super Mario Galaxy, Tiger Woods Golf, and Mario Kart Wii. </p>

<p>With the massive success of the Wii and the DS, it&rsquo;s easy to realize how Iwata&rsquo;s Nintendo made a massive impact on children and families around the world.</p>

  <p>Last year, Iwata did not attend E3 on advice from his doctor not to travel overseas. Later in the month, he underwent surgery to deal with a growth found in his bile duct, which in a note to company shareholders he acknowledged could be difficult to treat.</p>
  
  <p>Satoru Iwata was the fourth president of Nintendo, succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi, who had led the company into its modern identity as a titan of video gaming. Iwata had been a programmer for HAL Laboratory, today known for the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, before taking Nintendo&rsquo;s top job in 2002.</p>
  
  <p>As president of Nintendo, Iwata oversaw the introduction of two of the company&rsquo;s most profound successes — the Nintendo DS line of handhelds, and the Wii, both of which substantially widened the video game market in the preceding decade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WASHINGTON — Sometime in the next few weeks, aides expect President Obama to issue orders freeing dozens of federal prisoners locked up on nonviolent drug offenses. With the stroke of his pen, he will probably commute more sentences at one time than any president has in nearly half a century.</p>
  
  <p>The expansive use of his clemency power is part of a broader effort by Mr. Obama to correct what he sees as the excesses of the past, when politicians eager to be tough on crime threw away the key even for minor criminals. With many Republicans and Democrats now agreeing that the nation went too far, Mr. Obama holds the power to unlock that prison door, especially for young African-American and Hispanic men disproportionately affected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WASHINGTON — In a long-sought victory for the gay rights movement, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage.</p>
  
  <p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in the 5 to 4 decision. He was joined by the court’s four more liberal justices.</p>
  
  <p>The decision, the culmination of decades of litigation and activism, came against the backdrop of fast-moving changes in public opinion, with polls indicating that most Americans now approve of same-sex marriage.</p>
  
  <p>Justice Kennedy said gay and lesbian couples had a fundamental right to marry.</p>
  
  <p>“No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,” he wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.”</p>

      <a href="http://qz.com/432740/teaching-relaxation-to-at-risk-kids-could-lower-crime-and-dropout-rates/">Meditation practices show benefits amongst low-income teens</a><br/><p>The US National Bureau of Economic Research published results of a Chicago-based after-school program for area high-schoolers aimed at slowing down their decision making process. It taught the students basic breathing and meditation exercises as a way of controlling their emotions, and it appears to have worked.</p>

<p>The program reportedly resulted in &ldquo;significantly lowered crime and dropout rates for participants and boosted school attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Gabriel Fisher from Quartz writes, research shows that low-income teenagers greatly benefit from a slower decision making process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of the program, explains coauthor Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago and the director of its Crime Lab, was to encourage less violent behavior by slowing their automatic response, rather than telling the students to be less violent. “If you tell the kids never fight, you’re basically saying don’t listen to anything else we’re going to say,” he tells Quartz.</p>
  
  <p>In psychology, humans are thought to develop automatic responses to common situations to save time. For example, American teenagers from privileged backgrounds learn to automatically comply with authority figures, handing over their smartphone to a mugger, or quieting down when a teacher says so.</p>
  
  <p>Low-income teenagers sometimes learn that submitting to authorities on the street isn’t necessarily the smartest or safest choice. For instance, handing over your wallet, instead of shielding you from further harm, may only invite more aggression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are the real numbers, according to Robert Kondrk, the Apple executive who negotiates music deals along with media boss Eddy Cue: In the U.S., Apple will pay music owners 71.5 percent of Apple Music’s subscription revenue. Outside the U.S., the number will fluctuate, but will average around 73 percent, he told Re/code in an interview. Executives at labels Apple is working with confirmed the figures.</p>
  
  <p>Those totals include payments to the people who own the sound recordings Apple Music will play, as well as the people who own the publishing rights to songs’ underlying compositions. That doesn’t mean the money will necessarily go to the musicians who recorded or wrote the songs, since their payouts are governed by often-byzantine contracts with music labels and publishers.</p>
  
  <p>Apple won’t pay music owners anything for the songs that are streamed during Apple Music’s three-month trial period, a bone of contention with music labels during negotiations for the new service. But Kondrk says Apple’s payouts are a few percentage points higher than the industry standard, in part to account for the lengthy trial period; most paid subscription services offer a free one-month trial.</p>

  <p>These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.</p>
  
  <p>I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the streaming services go about paying artists, and Swift&rsquo;s post does little to help.</p>

<p>That said, it seems like the goal here is to get as many people as possible to try out Apple Music for 3 months. Free of charge. That means at the end of the three months, there&rsquo;s a mass of people who are just a click away from keeping or canceling a potentially highly lucrative service for Apple and the artists involved. I&rsquo;m assuming many people will keep the service.</p>

<p>Swift&rsquo;s motives may be sound, but they fail to consider the long haul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good afternoon, everybody. This morning, I spoke with, and Vice President Biden spoke with, Mayor Joe Riley and other leaders of Charleston to express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders that took place last night.</p>
<p>Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church. We knew their pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night. And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesn’t say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel. </p>
<p>Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship. </p>
<p>Mother Emanuel is, in fact, more than a church. This is a place of worship that was founded by African Americans seeking liberty. This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worshipers worked to end slavery. When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret. When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this church’s steps. This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.</p>
<p>The FBI is now on the scene with local police, and more of the Bureau’s best are on the way to join them. The Attorney General has announced plans for the FBI to open a hate crime investigation. We understand that the suspect is in custody. And I’ll let the best of law enforcement do its work to make sure that justice is served.</p>
<p>Until the investigation is complete, I’m necessarily constrained in terms of talking about the details of the case. But I don’t need to be constrained about the emotions that tragedies like this raise. I’ve had to make statements like this too many times. Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times. We don’t have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun. Now is the time for mourning and for healing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Federal Communications Commission slapped AT&amp;T with a $100 million fine Wednesday, accusing the country&rsquo;s second-largest cellular carrier of improperly slowing down Internet speeds for customers who had signed up for &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; data plans.</p>
  
  <p>The FCC found that when customers used up a certain amount of data watching movies or browsing the Web, AT&amp;T &ldquo;throttled&rdquo; their Internet speeds so that they were much slower than normal. Millions of AT&amp;T customers were affected by the practice, according to the FCC.</p>
  
  <p>The fine, which AT&amp;T says it will fight, is the largest ever levied by the agency.</p>

Schmidt at the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The attack would represent the first known case of corporate espionage in which a professional sports team hacked the network of another team. Illegal intrusions into companies’ networks have become commonplace, but it is generally conducted by hackers operating in foreign countries, like Russia and China, who steal large tranches of data or trade secrets for military equipment and electronics.</p>
  
  <p>Major League Baseball “has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach of the Astros’ baseball operations database,” a spokesman for baseball’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a written statement.</p>
  
  <p>The Cardinals officials under investigation have not been put on leave, suspended or fired. The commissioner’s office is likely to wait until the conclusion of the government’s investigation to determine whether to take disciplinary action against the officials or the team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The character Dusty Rhodes was in fact the man Virgil Runnels Jr. Born in rural Texas, Runnels’ father was a plumber and the family lived in poverty. The man who would later become “The American Dream” came of age in a predominantly black and Latino neighborhood. He also attended services at a local black Southern Baptist Church, absorbing the cadence and verbal style of its preachers.</p>
  
  <p>I first saw Dusty Rhodes on television during the early 1980s. My grandmother, a fan of roller derby and professional wrestling, would sit me down to watch the latter late at night and on the weekends. She, a black woman from rural North Carolina, had grown up watching all of the great wrestling in the Mid-Atlantic and National Wrestling Alliance “territories” (an industry term for the regional promotions that existed before the juggernaut now called the World Wrestling Entertainment gobbled them up). Watching with me then, my grandmother was extremely animated. She would yell at the television: “Look at that! That man Dusty Rhodes! He is a white soul brother! Beat up that Ric Flair and his phonies for the people, Dusty!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major setback for the Apple TV involves content. Apple plans to offer its Apple TV, iPhone and iPad customers a bundle of channels that is smaller and cheaper than the large catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription, according to people briefed on the service, who discussed the incomplete plans on the condition of anonymity. Media executives have been coy about the existence of the coming Apple TV service — the chief executive of CBS said last week that his network would “probably” sign a deal with Apple. Separately, Showtime announced on Wednesday a new Internet streaming service that would debut on Apple devices in July for a monthly fee of $10.99.</p>
  
  <p>But in the background, content providers have also whispered that they are far from reaching deals with Apple to offer an Internet-based TV service, largely because they have not come to an agreement on price, rights and technology issues, according to people briefed on the discussions.</p>

<p>Instead, we&rsquo;ll have &ldquo;settle&rdquo; for a Watch App tool kit, plus the yearly updates to iOS and OS X. I&rsquo;m still jazzed about it.</p>

<p>Great move by Valve. There have been plenty of times where I&rsquo;ve purchased a physical game and returned it after it didn&rsquo;t meet expectations. It&rsquo;s good to see digital sellers following suit.</p>

(Desktop versions also exist for Windows and OS X.) Back in March the company launched redesigned apps with smarter task management. Without any direct confirmation from Microsoft or Wunderlist, it&rsquo;s too soon to know Microsoft&rsquo;s plans for the app. Acompli was quickly folded into the company&rsquo;s product portfolio, while Sunrise has so far remained more independent and retained its original branding.</p>

      <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-face-corruption-charges-in-us.html">Top FIFA officials arrested, brought to U.S. for corruption charges</a><br/><p>Bombshell as first reported by the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ZURICH — Swiss authorities conducted an extraordinary early-morning operation here Wednesday to arrest several top soccer officials and extradite them to the United States on federal corruption charges.</p>
  
  <p>As leaders of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, gathered for their annual meeting, more than a dozen plain-clothed Swiss law enforcement officials arrived unannounced at the Baur au Lac hotel, an elegant five-star property with views of the Alps and Lake Zurich. They went to the front desk to get keys and proceeded upstairs to the rooms.</p>
  
  <p>The arrests were carried out peacefully. One FIFA official, Eduardo Li of Costa Rica, was led by the authorities from his room to a side-door exit of the hotel. He was allowed to bring his luggage, which was adorned with FIFA logos.</p>
  
  <p>The charges allege widespread corruption in FIFA over the past two decades, involving bids for World Cups as well as marketing and broadcast deals, according to three law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the case.</p>

  <p>Tuesday&rsquo;s rupture released as much as 2,500 barrels (105,000 gallons) of crude oil, five times more than the initial estimate, according to a &ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo; presented by pipeline owner Plains All American Pipeline. It said up to a fifth of the spill had reached the ocean.</p>
  
  <p>The 24-inch-wide (61-cm-wide) pipeline, which runs underground parallel to a coastal highway west of Santa Barbara, inexplicably burst on Tuesday morning, belching crude oil down a canyon, under a culvert and onto Refugio State Beach before it flowed into the Pacific, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By combining presidential election exit polls with mortality rates per age group from the U.S. Census Bureau, I calculated that, of the 61 million who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, about 2.75 million will be dead by the 2016 election. President Barack Obama’s voters, of course, will have died too—about 2.3 million of the 66 million who voted for the president won’t make it to 2016 either. That leaves a big gap in between, a difference of roughly 453,000 in favor of the Democrats.</p>
  
  <p>Here is the methodology, using one age group as an example: According to exit polls, 5,488,091 voters aged 60 to 64 years old supported Romney in 2012. The mortality rate for that age group is 1,047.3 deaths per 100,000, which means that 57,475 of those voters died by the end of 2013. Multiply that number by four, and you get 229,900 Romney voters aged 60-to-64 who will be deceased by Election Day 2016. Doing the same calculation across the range of demographic slices pulled from exit polls and census numbers allows one to calculate the total voter deaths. It’s a rough calculation, to be sure, and there are perhaps ways to move the numbers a few thousand this way or that, but by and large, this methodology at least establishes the rough scale of the problem for the Republicans—a problem measured in the mid-hundreds of thousands of lost voters by November 2016. To the best of my knowledge, no one has calculated or published better voter death data before.</p>

  <p>The gunfire erupted at about 12:15 p.m. outside of a Twin Peaks Restaurant, where the members of the motorcycle clubs had gathered. The fight spilled into the parking lot, initially involving just fists and feet, but escalating quickly to chains, knives, clubs and firearms. Waco police officers were already at the scene when the confrontation unfolded because they had anticipated problems as hundreds of bikers from at least five groups gathered at the shopping plaza.</p>
  
  <p>“When they approached the scene, there were multiple people on the scene firing weapons at each other,” Sgt. Patrick Swanton, a Waco Police Department spokesman, said at a news conference, referring to the officers in the area of the restaurant. “They then turned on our officers. Our officers returned gunfire, wounding and possibly killing several.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On some fronts, President Obama has pursued the most ambitious environmental agenda of any president, issuing new regulations intended to curb climate change, working toward an international global warming accord, and using his executive powers to put public lands off-limits from development. But he has also sought to balance those moves by opening up untouched federal waters to new oil and gas drilling.</p>
  
  <p>The Interior Department’s approval of the drilling was conditional on Shell’s receiving approval of a series of remaining drilling permits for the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the safest place to drill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both industry and environmental groups say that the Chukchi Sea is one of the most dangerous places in the world to drill. The area is extremely remote, with no roads connecting to major cities or deep water ports within hundreds of miles — which makes it difficult for clean-up and rescue workers to get to the site in case of an accident.</p>
  
  <p>The closest Coast Guard station with equipment for responding to a spill is over 1,000 miles away. The weather is extreme, with major storms, icy waters, and waves up to 50 feet high.</p>
  
  <p>The sea is also a major migration route and feeding area for marine mammals, including bowhead whales and walruses.</p>

  <p>To keep the turnaround between the analyst call and the posting of my transcript as short as possible, I use Rogue Amoeba’s excellent Audio Hijack, which I reviewed here in January. For past calls, I’ve taken notes during the call and then played back a recording in iTunes later, filling in the gaps. This time, I just started transcribing when the call started. A few minutes after the call was complete, I had a full transcript.</p>
  
  <p>In order to make this work, I use Audio Hijack’s Time Shift block, which lets me pause and rewind the audio I’m capturing—TiVo style!—as I listen. During Cook’s prepared remarks, I ended up several minutes behind the live stream, but by skipping over Apple CFO Luca Maestri’s remarks and the questions of analysts, I managed to catch up to nearly live before the end of the call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The women’s World Cup is rapidly approaching, and as countries gear up for the tournament, Nike has unveiled the home kits that the US women’s national team will wear on the field. The mostly black-and-white jerseys have sparked some outrage for not brandishing the colors of the US flag, but another of the jersey’s traits is sure to find more support.</p>
  
  <p>For the first time ever, the jerseys will be available in men’s sizes. As Bloomberg reported, Nike has had it in mind for some time to fix the very obvious double-standard of selling the men’s team jerseys in women’s and youth sizes but not offering guys a shot to wear the women’s team jerseys.</p>

<p>The kits are beautiful. I love the black and white design choice, it&rsquo;s simple while being a bit bold at the same time. I hope I can buy one of these.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the main provisions of the bills grants liability protection to companies that share (identity-stripped) information about their customers with the government. But in his statement, President Obama said he believes the protections the bills afford are too sweeping.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Appropriate liability protections should incentivize good cybersecurity practices and should not grant immunity to a private company for failing to act on information it receives about the security of its networks,&rdquo; the White House statement said. &ldquo;Such a provision would remove incentives for companies to protect their customers&rsquo; personal information and may weaken cybersecurity writ large.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Speaking specifically about the bill out of the the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which is expected to pass later today, April 22, the White House said the scope of the liability protections may even provide immunity to companies that are &ldquo;grossly negligent or even reckless.&rdquo; The president went on to express concerns that the collaborative information sharing intended for cybersecurity may be used by businesses for anticompetitive purposes.</p>

<p>These days, soccer teams across Europe are taking sleep, and the quality of sleep, very seriously. BBC detailed how many of the world&rsquo;s biggest clubs hired sleep coaches, like Nick Littlehales, to monitor players sleeping habits, then help them get the best rest. At Real Madrid, then-new signing Gareth Bale asked for a personal consultation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bale&rsquo;s biological clock - or circadian rhythm  to give it its proper title - means he naturally falls asleep and wakes up at later times, leaving his energy levels at their lowest early in the morning, before peaking in the afternoon.</p>
  
  <p>It&rsquo;s a problem Littlehales has encountered with countless athletes and in a bid to combat disruption to the body&rsquo;s preset patterns - which can also occur following European fixtures which finish late in the evening - he recommends naps.</p>
  
  <p>One player he worked with at Manchester City told him of his routine in the aftermath of Champions League games, which would see him stay up until 4am as he struggled to get to sleep with the adrenaline from the game still in his system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report also links to an article by Inside The Athletic Grind, which details how many other athletes, including Lebron James, sleep for <a href="http://insidetheathleticgrind.com/sleeping-much-lebron-james/" target="_blank">at least 10 hours a day</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: This report came out hours before it was confirmed that Real Madrid will be missing <a href="https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/590441375809871872" target="_blank">four key players, including Bale, due to injury</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He can be brutal about the leftwing media, too (CNN has been a frequent target, for being mediocre and too attached to pointless computer graphics). MSNBC, the liberal 24-hour news network, is, Stewart says, “better” than Fox News, “because it’s not steeped in distortion and ignorance as a virtue. But they’re both relentless and built for 9/11. So, in the absence of such a catastrophic event, they take the nothing and amplify it and make it craziness.”</p>
  
  <p>My biggest objection to Fox News, I say, is not the scaremongering, it’s the way it’s reshaped the Republican party. It will misrepresent social and economic issues, and promote the more extreme elements of the party, politicians such as Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, in a way that is hugely detrimental to American politics. (For the record, Rupert Murdoch disagrees, and last year claimed that Fox News “absolutely saved” the Republican party.) “Watching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,” says Stewart. “I live in a constant state of depression. I think of us as turd miners. I put on my helmet, I go and mine turds, hopefully I don’t get turd lung disease.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is how the scheme works. Facebook approaches a telco – in India’s case, Reliance – and offers to pay them the bandwidth costs of serving Facebook site and a small group of other sites.</p>
  
  <p>So when the poor, who in theory cannot afford a net connection come to the Facebook Zero service confusingly called Internet.org, they are made to believe they are on the internet while in reality they are only on Facebook and a few hand-picked sites.</p>
  
  <p>And the sites too are picked in secret under some unknown process. For instance, Facebook chose to offer the distant-second search engine Bing instead of industry-leading Google. Why? Is it rivalry with Google? Or because of Microsoft’s stake in Facebook? And then Facebook’s Zero product features a tiny job site like Babajob instead of the industry-leading Naukri. Why? So that the poor have fewer job options? No one knows. Facebook does not feature YouTube – the largest video site in the world and an immense education resource – but allows its own videos in full. It does not really look like charity any more, does it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was worried about this when I heard about Internet.org. It appears that it isn’t bringing the Internet to the poor, it’s instead bringing Facebook <i>as the internet</i>, along with the highest bidders.</p>

  <p>An enormous volume of racist, homophobic, sexist and other discriminatory abuse of Premier League footballers and clubs on social media has been revealed in new research for the game’s anti-discrimination organisation, Kick It Out.</p>
  
  <p>The search of Twitter, Facebook, supporters’ forums and blogs, using key abusive terms with players’ and club names, refined to identify direct abuse, found 134,400 discriminatory posts this season, from August 2014 to last month.</p>
  
  <p>The research has also highlighted the huge number of abusive posts received by some individual black players, finding that Mario Balotelli, of Liverpool, was sent more than 8,000 discriminatory posts on social media, of which more than half were racist. Danny Welbeck, who moved from Manchester United to Arsenal in September, received 1,700 abusive posts, exactly half involving racism. Daniel Sturridge was sent about 1,600 discriminatory posts, more than 60% abusing him on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The land — two tracts in Maine and North Carolina that, combined, are roughly two and a half times the size of Manhattan — will be managed by The Conservation Fund. This land is part of an estimated 45 million acres of private forest in the U.S. that are in danger of being lost to development.</p>
  
  <p>“Apple wanted to work with an organization that had the ability to acquire and manage these forests, and we’re thrilled about this partnership,” Larry Selzer, The Conservation Fund’s president, told BuzzFeed News. “Apple is doing something unprecedented here.”</p>
  
  <p>Though Apple will harvest pulp from these forests, other companies will also be able to buy fiber from them as well. Selzer’s organization will manage the forests under the “working forest” model, in which trees are harvested with what Daniel Brindis, a senior Forests Campaigner with Greenpeace, described to BuzzFeed News as “an eye toward the long-term economic well-being of the forest.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Realizing that on the iPhone the “phone” is but an app — one which I find populated with FaceTime calls rather than cellular calls and whose messaging history is filled with iMessage threads rather than SMS — I consider it safe to say what the iPhone is today not as much a phone as a very personal computer. And so the question is whether the Watch will quickly leave behind its timekeeping anchor and move into being something completely different.</p>
  
  <p>I had the chance to use the Watch for a few days and can say that timekeeping is probably as insignificant to its essence as it’s possible to be. It feels like a watch in the physical sense, looking good in the process (as the iPhone physically felt like a phone, also without being hard on the eyes)</p>

  <p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 10 invalidated several key claims of a patent that was used to sue several well-known podcasters. The invalidation means that the so-called &ldquo;podcasting patent&rdquo; can no longer be used to sue podcasters. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an advocacy group, had petitioned against the patent.</p>

      <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/04/08/apple-watch-meta-review/">Apple Watch reviews are here!</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;m bummed that the embargo fell at 8 a.m., instead of the usual midnight PST. That means I missed the initial review onslaught by a couple of hours. I sleep too much.</p>

<p>Anyways, Mashable is compiling a nifty cheat sheet as the reviews come out. In a perfect world, we would read every word of every review. It&rsquo;s just too bad we don&rsquo;t have the time.</p>

<p>The reviews, so far, are appropriately mixed. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch" target="_blank">John Gruber&rsquo;s review</a> is a great place to start. It seems pretty fair, and a good indication of just how new and unique this device is.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it should be no surprise that the Apple Watch is polarizing at launch. Such has been the case with every new product that Apple has ever released.</p>

  <p>When Apple’s next-generation Apple TV finally arrives at market later this year, it will bring a groaning board of new features to the company’s dusty set-top box — as BuzzFeed News first reported. But it will lack one that some Apple watchers had presumed inevitable: 4K video capability.</p>
  
  <p>Sources in position to know tell BuzzFeed News that the 4th generation Apple TV will not support 4K video — a newer high-definition video resolution that delivers a more detailed, immersive picture. “4K is great, but it’s still in its infancy,” said one source familiar with Apple’s thinking.?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rumors of an Apple-created television service have been around for almost as long as the rumors about an Apple-created television set, but a new report from the Wall Street Journal suggests we may know more soon. The WSJ claims that Apple will be launching a 25-or-so channel TV service for $30 or $40 a month that would include ABC, CBS, Fox, and various subsidiary channels like ESPN and FX.</p>
  
  <p>NBC is not part of the current talks, apparently because of conflicts with parent company Comcast. Apple&rsquo;s plans had previously been expected to include some kind of partnership with cable companies, combining their infrastructure and content with Apple&rsquo;s hardware and software. The Journal says those plans have been nixed, again because of friction with Comcast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So things are finally <a href="https://www.sling.com/" target="_blank">moving in the right direction</a>, but I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;re going to get stuck in a situation where no single service has the precise mix of channels. The goal is to make TV more affordable and accessible, but that&rsquo;s not the case if I have to pay for several different services just to get the content I want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo is being unusually candid about its product roadmap, with news that it will work on mobile titles with partner DeNA, and a reveal of its next console project – or at least the fact that it’s working on one. Nintendo’s Chief Executive Satoru Iwata told a press conference today that its next-generation console will be called NX, and is currently under development with a “brand new concept.”</p>
  
  <p>What Nintendo didn’t do was give us any indication of what NX is, or when it might arrive. Iwata did say that we’ll learn more about it next year, meaning it could make an initial appearance at E3 2016 or at its own dedicated unveiling. The news might be a candid admission that Wii U hasn’t been the home console Nintendo had hoped for, which might lead to a fast-forward refresh in the form of the NX, vs. an update cycle more in time with its competitors Sony and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;brand new concept&rdquo; quote is concerning. It could be VR, but I would be happy with a moderately powerful machine, with a nice controller that welcomes third party developers.</p>

  <p>Mario, Link and Donkey Kong could soon be coming to Android and iOS after Nintendo announced it will start developing games for smart devices. The company said the games wouldn&rsquo;t be ports of existing titles but would be &ldquo;completely new game experiences&rdquo;.</p>
  
  <p>Nintendo will partner with fellow Japanese developer DeNA and both companies creating games as part of the deal. All of Nintendo&rsquo;s franchises are up for grabs, the company confirmed. DeNA is responsible for one of Japan&rsquo;s most popular mobile gaming platforms and specialises in mobile and social games.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;To ensure the quality of game experience that consumers expect from this alliance of Nintendo and DeNA, only new original games optimised for smart device functionality will be created,&rdquo; Nintendo said in a statement. Details of specific titles in development and availability will be announced in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo plans to launch an online membership service as part of the deal. My guess is the games will be free downloads, but you&rsquo;ll have to be a paid subscriber in order to play the game. Nintendo can get use this as a way around the &ldquo;free-to-play&rdquo; shenanigans, but who knows if the service will be worth paying for.</p>

  <p>When the results were analyzed by age group and nationality, ETS got a shock.

  <p>Not only do Gen Y Americans lag far behind their overseas peers by every measure, but they even score lower than other age groups of Americans.</p>
  
  <p>Take literacy, for instance. American Millennials scored lower than their counterparts in every country that participated except Spain and Italy. (Japan is No. 1.) In numeracy, meaning the ability to apply basic math to everyday situations, Gen Yers in the U.S. ranked dead last.</p>

  <p>At the Apple event showcasing the watch, Tim Cook and team demonstrated a lot of cool apps. But none of them were mine. Don’t get me wrong. I’d do the same thing if I were Apple. Give your biggest and best partners first dibs on designing apps that will be featured. It makes sense. And some of those apps are made by companies in which I have investments. So good for me the investor. But bad for me the writer and publisher.</p>
  
  <p>Back in the day, no one got a heads up on anything. No one got to develop for a platform the rest of us didn’t get to access until after it launched. No one had to be approved to get put on the web. No one had to convince anyone else to feature them in a store in order to matter. Even writing this, I worry that someone in the app store might be less likely to put my NextDraft app on the front page (where, with god — who I imagine having much the same voice as Jony Ive during the demo movies — as my witness, it most certainly belongs).</p>

<p>I think the so-callled &ldquo;walled gardens&rdquo; of the App Store are crucial to the growth of the platform, and ultimately make it a better place to be. However, there&rsquo;s no question that Apple should work to make it a place for which <em>all</em> developers have a fair chance at prosperity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, when it comes to the battery at least, owners of Apple Watch will be able to extend its lifespan. An Apple spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch the “battery is replaceable”. Albeit, it’s not clear how much it will cost to send in your wearable to Apple to get it returned with a new cell in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume it&rsquo;s similar to all of Apple&rsquo;s devices: It&rsquo;s possible to do but, depending on which model you have, it may not be entirely cost effective.</p>

      <p>Today’s Apple event delivered in many ways. We knew there would be release info on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a>, but we didn’t expect an update on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/appletv/" target="_blank">Apple TV</a> followed by a bonkers <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">all-new Macbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Apple TV</h2>

<p>First, Tim Cook invited HBO CEO Richard Plepler the stage. Plepler detailed the all-new HBO Now service, which only requires that you have an Internet connection…and an Apple TV.</p>

<p>This is surely not the killer-app that Apple has been aiming for all along, but it’s still a much-needed high-profile exclusive that could draw customers to the Apple TV.</p>

<p>HBO Now will cost $14.99 per month (with a 30-day free trial), which corresponds nicely to the price drop of Apple TV itself: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/apple-tv-price-dropping-from-99-to-69/" target="_blank">$69, down from $99</a>.</p>

<p>The price makes the Apple TV much more competitive with the competition, and it leaves room for a top-tier set-top model. Perhaps the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/05/apple-plans-relaunched-beats-streaming-music-service-for-wwdc-skipping-march-event/" target="_blank">rumored, slimmer Apple TV</a> with an improved remote and App Store will land at WWDC?</p>

<h2>MacBook</h2>

<p>It had been rumored before, but I don’t think anyone truly expected to see the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" target="_blank">12-inch MacBook</a> unveiled today. It was such a beautifully pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>It’s thinner than the MacBook Air, comes in three finishes just like the iPhone and iPad, all while being reasonably priced with thoughtful specifications.</p>

<p>The MacBook also features a redesigned keyboard and a Force Touch trackpad. The trackpad is a marvel, as it finally gets rid of the old-fashioned clicking mechanism. Instead, it has all new force sensors with tactile vibration.</p>

<p>I’ve been going touch only on all of my trackpads for years. It’s way easier on the wrist. Force Touch shows Apple going all-in with similar technology. The sheer thinness of the device probably forced them to do so.</p>

<p>The keyboard features all new switch mechanisms for each key. Apple says it makes the keys far more stable, all while reducing key travel significantly. Again, it’s was likely a necessity, and I wonder how I’ll handle keys with such short travel. Regardless, I really want this machine.</p>

<h2>Watch</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a> will be available on April 24. <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/watch" target="_blank">Prices</a> run from $349 to $15,000, the lowest being the Sport while the Edition sits at the top.</p>

<p>Tim Cook made it clear that the Edition will be a low quantity device sold in select stores. It indicates that only a small portion of the world’s wealthiest people will be going for one of these. It’s not a huge priority, but Apple will be happy to sell them to a qualified buyer. Those buyers are out there, and with Apple being the wealthiest company on Earth, they might as well make a play at taking their money.</p>

<p>People will surely freak out and pay too much attention to the price of the Edition. They’ll be missing the fact that the aluminum Sport and stainless Watch models are priced competitively.</p>

<p>I don’t see any reason why I would want to go for the stainless steel model. They look amazing, but with my budget, I’ll be perfectly happy with the Space Gray sport model with the black band. Simple.</p>

<p>On Twitter, I’m seeing a lot of people expressing excitement over the price of the stainless steel model: $549-$1,099. The prices cover a lot of ground and band styles, and they’ll make a lot of money for Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/watch/watch-accessories" target="_blank">Band pricing</a> is interesting as well. Fluoroelastomer Sport bands run $49, while the link bracelet tops out at $449.</p>

<p>Do you need an Apple Watch? No. Will it help vastly improve your experience with the iPhone and other Apple products? I think so.</p>

<p>The fitness benefits alone make the Watch and interesting proposition. The Watch can track all sorts of health information, privately, giving you a clear view of what areas need improvement.</p>

<p>Then, you have an all new way to communicate without ever taking your phone out of your pocket. There will always be a time to use your phone, but it won’t be every waking second of the day.</p>

<p>There are just a ton of ways (big and small) that the Watch could potentially improve your digital life. It brings all the noise to one simple device on your wrist, one that also works to make you healthier.</p>

<p>One problem: I’m already sick of listening to people’s crappy ringtones. Now, I’ll have to hear them shouting from both their phone and their watch at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Same-sex marriage “incompatible with the Constitution,” the Obama administration Friday filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court in support of couples who are making challenges in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;The marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights, responsibilities and status of civil marriage,&rdquo; Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote. He said the states have &ldquo;burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches, from the mundane to the profound.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>The brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide.</p>
  
  <p>The court will hear arguments in the state cases on April 28.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to CNET, the Apple executive explained the feature thusly: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to authenticate on the phone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your watch has to be unlocked, and your phone can unlock your watch.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;If I took my watch off and gave it to you, it would know and no longer work. If I wanted to pay right now, I could pay with the watch and not have to take the phone out of my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>The Apple Watch&rsquo;s health sensors know when the device is strapped to your wrist and when it&rsquo;s off your person. According to Cue, Apple is taking advantage of that data to simplify the payment experience. You will, however, need to confirm a payment by tapping the button on the side of the Apple Watch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It just works.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s strange that Apple would have a high-level exec detailing how the service works outside of their own event, <em>before</em> the device launch.</p>

      <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/3/the-watch-and-the-store">How will Apple sell the Watch Edition?</a><br/><p>Stephen Hackett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The staffing question is more interesting, and, perhaps, more complex. If Apple does carve out some private space in all of their stores for high-end clientele, I think the company may have a problem here as well. Many stores I have visited staffed by mostly young people, and while they may be wearing polo shirts these days, there’s no getting around the fact that Apple Stores may just have the wrong kind of sales clerks to sell a $10,000 watch. That’s delicate and awkward, but I think it’s true.</p>
  
  <p>I’m starting to think the Apple Watch Edition will not be available at all of Apple’s stores immediately. I can see it being in select Apple Stores in cities like New York, L.A., London and Paris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>If someone walks into any old Apple Store and says, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s $XXXXX, give me the Edition,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure that store will be prepared to accommodate them. Otherwise, it really doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have them available in every single market. Not at launch.</p>

  <p>And the problem wasn&rsquo;t just with Roku. When HBO Go on the Playstation 3 was released, it worked with every other TV-Everywhere compatible provider, but not Comcast. When customerscomplained in the Comcast forums, they were greeted with total silence. When customers called in to try and figure out why HBO Go wouldn&rsquo;t work, they usually received incorrect statements from front level support (it should arrive in 48 hours, don&rsquo;t worry!).</p>
  
  <p>Fast forward nearly a year since the HBO Go Playstation 3 launch (it still doesn&rsquo;t work), and Sony has now announced an HBO Go app for the Playstation 4 console. And guess what &ndash; when you go to activate the app you&rsquo;ll find it works with every major broadband ISP &ndash; except Comcast. Why? Comcast still won&rsquo;t really say, but the company appears to have backed away from claims that the delay is due to technical or customer support issues, and is now telling forum visitors the hangup is related to some ambiguous business impasse:</p>

  <p>LOS ANGELES — It seemed like routine business for the student council at the University of California, Los Angeles: confirming the nomination of Rachel Beyda, a second-year economics major who wants to be a lawyer someday, to the council’s Judicial Board.</p>
  
  <p>Until it came time for questions.</p>
  
  <p>“Given that you are a Jewish student and very active in the Jewish community,” Fabienne Roth, a member of the Undergraduate Students Association Council, began, looking at Ms. Beyda at the other end of the room, “how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view?”</p>
  
  <p>For the next 40 minutes, after Ms. Beyda was dispatched from the room, the council tangled in a debate about whether her faith and affiliation with Jewish organizations, including her sorority and Hillel, a popular student group, meant she would be biased in dealing with sensitive governance questions that come before the board, which is the campus equivalent of the Supreme Court.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A prominent American blogger of Bangladeshi origin was hacked to death with machetes by unidentified assailants in Dhaka, police said, with the atheist writer’s family claiming he had received numerous threats from Islamists.</p>
  
  <p>The body of Avijit Roy, founder of Mukto-Mona (Free-mind) blog site which champions liberal secular writing in the Muslim-majority nation, was found covered in blood after the attack which also left his wife critically wounded.</p>

      <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-votes-yes-net-neutrality/">"A Huge Win for the Internet"</a><br/><p>Robert McMillan at Wired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the vote, the FCC is changing the way it views both wireless and fixed-line broadband service providers, reclassifying them as “Title II” common carriers under the nation’s telecommunications laws. The Title II designation, which already covers voice services, gives the FCC the ability to set rates, open up access to competitors, and generally more closely regulate the broadband industry. It’s a reversal of course for the FCC, which until now did not even enforce net neutrality rules on wireless broadband services, and very lightly regulated fixed providers. But it’s also a return to the regulatory regime that governed consumer internet services 20 years ago, when hundreds of dial-up internet service providers competed on Title II-regulated phone networks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over half of Republicans answered &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; when asked which religion describes President Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;deep down&rdquo; beliefs, according to a newly released poll by Alex Theodoridis of the University of California at Merced.</p>
  
  <p>Theodoridis, who released the results on Wednesday on the Washington Post political science blog Monkey Cage, asked Americans this question: &ldquo;Which of these do you think most likely describes what Obama believes deep down? Muslim, Christian, atheist, spiritual, or I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The poll was conducted in the fall of 2014.</p>
  
  <p>The results, divided by party affiliation, are shown above. And they&rsquo;re pretty staggering. Among Republicans, 54 percent answered &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; when asked what Obama believes; only nine percent said &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; his stated religion.</p>

  <p>The studio&rsquo;s previous Batman games, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, both earned &ldquo;T for Teen&rdquo; ratings. Sefton Hill, founder of Rocksteady and game director on Arkham Knight, said the M rating surprised him because the team didn&rsquo;t specifically aim for it.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;From our point of view, we never wrote it or made it with a rating in mind. We never did that in the previous two games&hellip; We just felt that this is the story that we really wanted to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that a studio handling the Batman pedigree would focus solely on the story without being persuaded by industry pressure. There is clearly a boatload of money to be made by making it &ldquo;E&rdquo; or &ldquo;T&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, a core of engineers and scientists had split off via group email and included me. We called ourselves the Independent Group,11 or IG. If you found yourself wondering how a satellite with geosynchronous orbit responds to a shortage of hydrazine, all you had to do was ask.12 The IG’s first big break came in late May, when the Malaysians finally released the raw Inmarsat data. By combining the data with other reliable information, we were able to put together a time line of the plane’s final hours: Forty minutes after the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, MH370 went electronically dark. For about an hour after that, the plane was tracked on radar following a zigzag course and traveling fast. Then it disappeared from military radar. Three minutes later, the communications system logged back onto the satellite. This was a major revelation. It hadn’t stayed connected, as we’d always assumed. This event corresponded with the first satellite ping. Over the course of the next six hours, the plane generated six more handshakes as it moved away from the satellite.</p>

Finally, companies are letting go of their clunky, in-house digital interfaces and letting in people who actually know what their doing.</p>

<p>The change is detailed in an article from the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While automakers traditionally aimed to control all aspects of the infotainment experience — building their own closed-off, proprietary systems — the results were not always stellar. And the pace of technology meant a car’s hardware and software could become dated quickly.</p>
  
  <p>In some cases, the systems carried what seemed to be needless costs, like an annual fee for updating map software — something unthinkable for any user of Google Maps or Apple Maps.</p>

<p>Toyota is one of the only holdouts left, but I suspect it will be to their detriment.</p>

  <p>Speeding up shows isn&rsquo;t the only way networks are trying to fit in ad time.

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Stewart, whose contract with Comedy Central ends in September, disclosed his plans during a taping of the program on Tuesday. Saying that “in my heart, I know it is time for someone else” to have the opportunity he had, Mr. Stewart told his audience that he was still working out the details of his departure, which “might be December, might be July.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This breaks my heart. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m amongst millions of people whose ideals and world-view have been informed by Stewart&rsquo;s insight. No matter how grim the subject matter, Stewart&rsquo;s humor has helped give me hope through countless crises.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sling TV (not to be confused with the Slingbox television set-top box), can be accessed on the iPhone and iPad via an iOS app. Dish is offering users a seven day free trial, so you can see if this &ldquo;cord-cutting&rdquo; option is right for you before paying the monthly fee. In addition to the $20 tier, which offers a collection of 15 channels, customers can pay for additional collections of sports, news and kids channels for $5 a month each.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m extremely tempting to make the leap. I would be giving up a couple of channels, but I would save upwards of $60/month. With Dish, I have to pay for one of (if not <em>the</em>) highest tiers just so I can watch soccer on NBCSN and beIN Sports.</p>

<p>I was also concerned about the lack of DVR, until I read the company&rsquo;s <a href="http://help.sling.com/FAQs" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. Sling TV includes a 3-day replay feature that allows you to watch shows that have aired in the past three days on the following channels: HGTV, DIY, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, Food Network, Galavision, El Rey, Univision Deportes, Universal Sports, and beIN Sports and we expect this list to grow. Sling International customers can enjoy exclusive 8-day replay on all international channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the biggest downfall is the lack of device support. I have very little interest in watching from a mobile device. We have an old Roku sitting around, but I would much prefer to watch from my Apple TV and Playstation 4. I assume support for both device is on the way, but it can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has delivered a major new release of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system each year since 2007, generally marketing major iOS changes as a reason to buy new devices. In 2013, Apple completely overhauled the iOS user interface at the same time as it added new features such as Touch ID and Control Center. iOS 8 in 2014 refined the UI design, added Health and Apple Pay, while laying the groundwork for the Apple Watch.</p>
  
  <p>For 2015, iOS 9, which is codenamed Monarch, is going to include a collection of under-the-hood improvements. Sources tell us that iOS 9 engineers are putting a “huge” focus on fixing bugs, maintaining stability, and boosting performance for the new operating system, rather than solely focusing on delivering major new feature additions. Apple will also continue to make efforts to keep the size of the OS and updates manageable, especially for the many millions of iOS device owners with 16GB devices.</p>

  <p>Bankruptcy protection wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that RadioShack intends to go out of business. Rather, it would mean RadioShack would be given a certain period of time to rebuild itself and shield itself from creditors.

<blockquote>
  <p>To make the feature speedy, Apple would periodically check Twitter for the latest links shared by people you follow. It didn’t matter if you were a Twitter addict or just signed up for an account one day, connected it to your iPhone, and promptly forgot about it. Because Apple kept checking your account for data, you would count as a monthly active user in Twitter’s statistics.</p>
  
  <p>But when Apple released iOS 8 in September, it also changed how Safari’s shared links work. It no longer automatically asks Twitter for information, instead updating only when you actually open up the feature. Do it now, and if you are using iOS 8, you’ll see it takes a few seconds to load. (Oh, and if you do that, congratulations, you are now one of Twitter’s 288 million monthly active users, or MAUs.)</p>

  <p>It is expected that the proposal will reclassify high-speed Internet service as a telecommunications service, instead of an information service, under Title II of the Communications Act, according to industry analysts, lobbyists and former F.C.C. staff members.</p>
  
  <p>The change, the analysts and others say, which has been pushed by President Obama, would give the commission strong legal authority to ensure that no content is blocked and no so-called pay-to-play fast lanes exist — prohibitions that are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept.</p>
  
  <p>But Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, will advocate a light-touch approach to Title II, they say, shunning the more intrusive aspects of utility-style regulation, like meddling in pricing decisions. He may also suggest putting wireless data services under Title II and adding regulations for companies that manage the backbone of the Internet.</p>

      <p>After serving a third of his sentence for a brutal murder of a Dallas woman and her two children, Robert Ladd was released on parole. He narrowly avoided the death penalty after courts learned that his IQ was below 70. The AP writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They cite a psychiatrist&rsquo;s determination that Ladd, then a 13-year-old in custody of the Texas Youth Commission, had an IQ of only 67. Courts have embraced scientific studies that consider an IQ of 70 a threshold for impairment, and the Supreme Court has barred execution of mentally impaired people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the clear indication that Ladd was not mentally stable and the fact that he likely served as a danger to himself and/or to others, they just let him go.</p>

<p>Four years later, Ladd was arrested again, this time for an equal brutal murder of a mentally impaired woman in East Texas. Like the first murder, the body was left inside a burning apartment.</p>

<p>Now, Ladd is again facing the death penalty and it&rsquo;s very unlikely that his appeals will be heard this time around. Nevermind the fact that he should have never been released from prison in the first place. Nevermind the fact that it&rsquo;s the justice systems failure to properly handle the case of a man with obvious and severe mental issues.</p>

<p>Texas Assistant Attorney General disagrees with the ACLU&rsquo;s request to rely on science and medicine when making their decision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assistant Attorney General Kelli Weaver told the court that his claim that he&rsquo;s mentally impaired &ldquo;has been repeatedly rejected and he argues neither a new factual basis nor a new legal basis on which the judgments of the state and federal courts should be questioned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a person who previously tested with a low IQ in their teens, who goes on to commit two similarly gruesome murders, doesn&rsquo;t meet the threshold for mental impairment?</p>

<p>What about people who repeatedly decide that others should be killed strictly based on revenge and political gain?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Determined to stymie the inevitable flood of fraudulent transactions using Apple Pay and other mobile wallets, one Missouri lawmaker has proposed a new law that would require shoppers to pull out a photo ID and prove they truly are who they say they are before they will be allowed to continue with the process of scanning their unique fingerprint on a high-tech piece of equipment designed specifically for the purpose of verifying their identity without the need for a physical identification card.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a limit of 8 Mbps, the image returned to what seemed like 720p HD and boasted a solid frame rate throughout. At this bandwidth level, the only issues were occasional compression artifacts appearing as small, scrambled boxes of pixels for a few frames here and there. By the time we hit 9 Mbps of download speed, streaming once again felt like local play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That strikes me as a pretty astounding figure. I assumed a 15-20Mbps connection would be considered ideal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really pulling for Playstation Now in the long term. $20/mo is just too expensive. I would bet that when people think &ldquo;streaming service,&rdquo; they immediately think $10/mo ala Netflix. If Sony can find a way to expand the library while simultaneously lowering the price of the service, they might have their killer app.</p>

  <p>It’s not the complicated stuff we have chosen to forget because we ran out of energy as the league stalled and stalled until the clock ran out. It’s not the commissioner who ignored a domestic violence crisis, then hired the same company that negotiated the league’s latest TV deal to conduct an “independent investigation” to absolve the NFL and commissioner of any wrongdoing. It’s not the concussion problem, either, or the Pro Bowler on trial for allegedly murdering three people over two seasons.</p>
  
  <p>The problem with the NFL is the New England Patriots, who were caught using underinflated footballs that were hypothetically easier to catch in their 38-point romp over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game.</p>

  <p>A letter sent to parents in the state states that &ldquo;If your child has an account on a social networking website, e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, ask.fm, etc., please be aware that State law requires school authorities to notify you that your child may be asked to provide his or her password for these accounts to school officials in certain circumstances.&rdquo; No subpoena or warrant is required for the demand, just the agreement of school officials. The agreement process isn&rsquo;t codified in the law, and is left up to school districts to decide what is considered &ldquo;certain circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Superintendent of the Triad district Leigh Lewis in Illinois told Motherboard that there could be criminal charges if parents fail to comply. Lewis said that &ldquo;if they didn&rsquo;t turn over the password, we would call our district attorneys because they would be in violation of the law.

<p>No offense to the Kaka’s, Lamapard’s and Gerrard&rsquo;s out there.  Those guys are good for the league as well, but MLS has to sign more players like Giovinco if they want to keep expanding the league.</p>

<p>There is (and never will be) a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; laptop because laptops are a disaster of ergonomics. Using one as it&rsquo;s designed requires sitting, slumped down, as both hands extend at odd angles to operate the device.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Well, the first time that I got it I was just ten years old / I got it from some kitty next door / An’ I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure / I think I got it some more / […] / Well, I make the pussy purr with the stroke of my hand / They know they gettin’ it from me / They know just where to go when they need their lovin’ man / They know I’m doin’ it for free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a report titled, &ldquo;Community-based broadband solutions: The benefits of competition and choice for community development and highspeed Internet access,&rdquo; the White House said it wants to &ldquo;end laws that harm broadband service competition.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Laws in 19 states—some specifically written by special interests trying to stifle new competitors—have held back broadband access and, with it, economic opportunity,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;Today President Obama is announcing a new effort to support local choice in broadband, formally opposing measures that limit the range of options to available to communities to spur expanded local broadband infrastructure, including ownership of networks. As a first step, the Administration is filing a letter with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urging it to join this effort by addressing barriers inhibiting local communities from responding to the broadband needs of their citizens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solid move.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Popular messaging services like Snapchat and WhatsApp are in the cross hairs in Britain.</p>
  
  <p>That was the message delivered on Monday by Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he would pursue banning encrypted messaging services if Britain’s intelligence services were not given access to the communications.</p>
  
  <p>The statement comes as many European politicians are demanding that Internet companies like Google and Facebook provide greater information about people’s online activities after several recent terrorist threats, including the attacks in Paris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dreadful idea, to be sure.</p>

<p>Governments shouldn&rsquo;t have access to everything just because they cite such broad issues as &ldquo;because terrorism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s already been made clear that law enforcement agencies can (and should) fend off terrorism through more traditional methods. Particularly, ones that don&rsquo;t compromise the privacy of billions of people.</p>

<p>It will be very interesting to see what our 2016 presidential candidates have to say about this issue in the coming months.</p>

  <p>Social networks are designed around who you are and who you know.

  <p>So, Volkswagen problem number one: this brand still does not make a credible midsize sport-utility vehicle. Folks, I don&rsquo;t know how to stress this enough. The Ford Explorer, which is widely regarded as the first hugely successful &ldquo;family car&rdquo; SUV, debuted for the 1991 model year. It came out twenty-five years ago. Next year, the very first Explorers will be eligible for collector vehicle plates. And despite the Explorer&rsquo;s popularity, and the ensuing rise of the SUV, and rivals from every brand between Mitsubishi and Hyundai, Volkswagen is still taking a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; approach to this segment. You have to wonder if the Germans are holed up in an office in Wolfsburg, staring out the window, dark suits on, telling each other that &ldquo;really, the midsize SUV is just a passing fad.&rdquo;</p>

Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook.

  <p>Are you as enthusiastic about demonstrating recent versions of OS X as you were about Leopard? Have you avoided family members who keep asking you why their iPhones don’t have enough free space to install iOS 8?

Even a televised CNBC discussion segment.</p>
  
  <p>All of them using my name, and a few of my words, to create drama, fan the flames, and get some views.</p>

  <p>The reality is that it’s hard to come up with a single reason for Apple’s modern software woes. And the most likely explanation is that they’re the result of a series of trade-offs, deadlines, and wrong decisions that contributed to the overall product.</p>
  
  <p>Which brings me to the argument that “Apple should slow down” and “have a Snow Leopard release” (not directly expressed in Marco’s piece). After putting a lot of thought into this, I simply believe it won’t happen and that we’d end up being concerned anyway.</p>

      <p>Marco Arment has been speaking out at several issues plaguing Apple&rsquo;s software side lately. He often refers to issues with the App Store, like <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/12/16/how-broken-is-discovery-on-the-app-store" target="_blank">app discovery</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/12/08/transmit-rejection" target="_blank">the review process</a>. These are real issues for real developers, but it appears Apple <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/03/getting-help-with-app-reviews-and-rejections" target="_blank">is working on it</a>.</p>

<p>Now, Marco is going even farther, arguing that Apple has <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground" target="_blank">lost &ldquo;the functional high ground&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has completely lost the functional high ground. “It just works” was never completely true, but I don’t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer. We now need to treat Apple’s OS and application releases with the same extreme skepticism and trepidation that conservative Windows IT departments employ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perfectly fair point. Both Mac OS X and iOS 8 are rough in some spots, but it also works really well in most of the areas that most people use the most.</p>

<p>Later, Federico Viticci tweeted his thoughts on the outcry:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>And I feel like iOS/OS X geeks rightfully see a lot of the details gone wrong and sometimes skip over the big picture (myself included).</p>— Federico Viticci (@viticci) <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/551940594902499328" target="_blank">January 5, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>Nailed it.</p>

<p>Arment linked to a post from <a href="http://wozniak.ca/why-i-quit-os-x" target="_blank">Geoff Wozniak</a>, who recently decided to quit using OS X in favor of Linux. This passage, however, struck me as a bit odd:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once I quit, I was met with different frustrations, but they didn&rsquo;t feel like hopeless frustrations.  I&rsquo;ve gone back to a desktop system running Linux (for now) and while I consider it markedly inferior to OS X in terms of usability, it feels like a personal computer again.  I&rsquo;m enjoying the experience and I look forward to working with it, even when it&rsquo;s a monumental pain in the ass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;markedly inferior&rdquo; to Mac OS X, yet he&rsquo;s more willing to work on it. Why?</p>

<p>Apple is moving at an incredible pace. The industry hasn&rsquo;t really seen anything like it before. It recently unveiled major redesigns to the leading desktop/laptop operating system <em>and</em> the leading mobile operating system <em>at the same time</em>. We&rsquo;re also months or weeks away from the launch of an all new <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/" target="_blank">product category</a></p>

<p>Apple is also doing all this in a time when when sales for devices running that the aforementioned software are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/20/technology/apple-earnings/index.html" target="_blank">at or near record highs</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s plenty of work to do with issues that need to be corrected. There always will be. Yet, I&rsquo;m not convinced this is the crisis that some are making it out to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first sent it in, and it came back, and it crashed. So I went to the Apple Store in the Galleria in Saint Louis, MO. 5 days later, I got it back again, and sadly crashed once more. Last week I dropped it off the day after Christmas, and today I got it back once more. This was the 3rd time and they basically replaced everything. I got home and started to restore my back up, when once again it crashed.</p>
  
  <p>I was so annoyed, upset but mostly frustrated at the fact this kept happening. I called the store and spoke with the Apple Tech head guy and he told me to bring everything in, and we would go from there.</p>
  
  <p>I got to the store with an hour left before they closed, and when he came out with a new computer I was shocked. The new computer is the more advanced of the Macbook family, and it will come in handy with my photography company. The whole time the Store Manager, Apple Genius guys, and floor people checked up on me as my brand new computer restored. They even let my Dad and I stay after they closed to finish everything. They answered all of my questions, and my parents and they were so sweet and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My girlfriend once had trouble with her white Macbook. I can&rsquo;t remember what it was. We took it to the very same Apple Store for repair.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was out of warranty (she didn&rsquo;t buy Applecare), but they still fixed it and gave her a huge discount on the repair. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact amount, but it turned the bill from <em>life altering</em> for two college students to <em>perfectly manageable</em>.</p>

<p>Then, they replaced the top casing that was prone to yellowing. They replaced this piece every time she brought it in.</p>

<p>Now we buy Applecare for just about everything. See how that works?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.</p>
  
  <p>When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.</p>
  
  <p>My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.</p>

  <p>Nearly 20 months after Maryland abolished capital punishment, Gov. Martin O’Malley said Wednesday that he would empty the state’s death row by commuting the sentences of four inmates who were awaiting execution.</p>
  
  <p>“In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland — present or future,” Mr. O’Malley, a Democrat who will leave office in January and may seek the presidency in 2016, said in a statement. “Gubernatorial inaction at this point in the legal process would, in my judgment, needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.”</p>

  <p>The F.D.A. enacted the ban in 1983, early in the AIDS epidemic.

<blockquote>
  <p>Autcraft is one of hundreds of thousands of active Minecraft servers, but one of only a few that caters exclusively to children, young adults, and parents of children with autism and Asperger’s. Painstakingly moderated by a team of dutiful (and intensely vetted) volunteers, Autcraft is a safe haven to 5,000 players from all over the world and arguably one of the best communities on the internet.</p>
  
  <p>Autcraft’s founder and cult hero (according to one parent, “He’s like Elvis in there!”) is Stuart Duncan, a web developer from Timmons, Canada, who goes by the handle AutismFather. In 2013, Duncan, who has Asperger’s syndrome and is the father of children with autism, had been keeping a blog about raising children with autism when he noticed that a number of parents of autistic children in his various networks were struggling to find a safe place for their kids to play Minecraft. Parents were complaining that most Minecraft servers subjected their children to bullies, trolls, foul language, and other emotionally disturbing behavior. Duncan, who had already been playing the game with his kids, bought a $2.50 starter server that he named Autcraft and invited 400 people from his blog’s Facebook page, expecting few responses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the name, Story Mode isn&rsquo;t an additional campaign in the core Minecraft game, but a separate, &ldquo;narrative-driven&rdquo; episodic series in the standard Telltale model. That means a story that&rsquo;s &ldquo;driven by player choice,&rdquo; which integrates &ldquo;new characters with familiar themes, in an entirely original Minecraft experience, inspired by the Minecraft community and the game that continues to inspire a generation,&rdquo; according to Telltale&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a smart move to me. Mojang insists that it&rsquo;s just another part of the Minecraft experience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re not intending on creating an “official” story for Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail. It will be a cool game.</p>

  <p>According to Spanish site Motor Y Racing, a US version of the Civic Type R is in the works.

</blockquote>

<p>If it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s a long time coming. Honda is getting crushed in the performance compact category by Ford, Volkswagen, and even Fiat. Bringing over the Type-R engine would put them right back at the top of the heap.</p>

<p>PLUS, rumors also say that same engine could find it&rsquo;s way into he CR-Z. That&rsquo;s big news to a former CRX driver like myself.</p>

      <a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2014/12/no-lets-not-bring-back-the-suits/">No, let's not bring back the suits</a><br/><p>Jason Snell tells it like it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nunziato’s argument is that the old days, when corporate suits made business decisions about what music would be the most marketable, were good days. Because when the suits made all the decisions, there wasn’t an infinite amount of music to choose from.</p>
  
  <p>The curation aspect of what those music-industry suits and their A&amp;R men and their talent scouts and the rest, that did (and does) have value. Today, more than ever, people who can identify what’s worth listening to (or reading, or watching) are incredibly valuable. There’s so much stuff out there, that it’s impossible for any person to try it all. We need to look to people who match our tastes to recommend things to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Snell later points out, someone can write a song and, if it connects with people, can be out into the world in seconds. It&rsquo;s incredible, and not something to be stifled by cynics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nucleus accumbens is part of the dopamine system, which affects how we learn, and is generally known for motivating us to search for rewards. The difference in the dopamine system in the extrovert’s brain tends to push them towards seeking out novelty, taking risks, and enjoying unfamiliar or surprising situations more than others. The amygdala is responsible for processing emotional stimuli, which gives extroverts that rush of excitement when they try something highly stimulating that might overwhelm an introvert.</p>
  
  <p>More research has actually shown that the difference comes from how introverts and extroverts process stimuli. That is, the stimulation coming into our brains is processed differently depending on your personality. For extroverts, the pathway is much shorter. It runs through an area where taste, touch, and visual and auditory sensory processing takes place. For introverts, stimuli run through a long, complicated pathway in areas of the brain associated with remembering, planning, and solving problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the case of Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda founder who was tracked to a hideout in Pakistan and killed by US forces during a raid in 2011, the CIA claimed that detainees subjected to what they call “enhanced interrogation techniques” had identified the courier who ultimately led them to their target.</p>
  
  <p>However, this report—based on an extensive analysis of the CIA’s own files—says Bin Laden’s courier had long been under surveillance, and more than two dozen sources discussed him. The person who provided the most detailed information, a senior Al Qaeda fundraiser and logistical facilitator named Hassan Ghul, provided it after being captured in 2004—before he was subjected to the “enhanced interrogation techniques.” An CIA officer reported that he “sang like a tweetie bird…opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset.”</p>
  
  <p>But after providing that information, the report says he was taken to a different detention site, where he was shaved, stripped, and stood against a wall with his hands raised over his head for two hours at a time. After 59 hours of sleep deprivation, he began experiencing hallucinations and complaining of pain, but gave no further information. While additional details of his interrogation and release were redacted, the report says he eventually wound up in a Pakistani prison, was released and ultimately killed in 2012 by a US drone strike in Pakistan.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/12/07/zuckerberg-responds-to-you-are-the-product.html">Zuckerberg responds to "you are the product"</a></h1>

      <a href="http://time.com/facebook-world-plan/">Zuckerberg responds to "you are the product"</a><br/><p>Mark Zuckerberg was recently profiled in Time magazine, this time for his efforts to get internet (and, arguably, more importantly, Facebook) to every corner of the world. It&rsquo;s all very interesting stuff, but tech sites are really latching on to Zuckerberg&rsquo;s comments about and towards Ello, Apple, and others:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I asked him about Ello, an upstart for-pay social network built on the premise that it doesn’t show you ads and doesn’t harvest your personal information. When a social network does those things, Ello’s manifesto argues, “You’re the product that’s being bought and sold.” Zuckerberg’s take was, as usual, practical: whatever ethical merits it might have, the business model won’t scale. “Our mission is to connect every person in the world. You don’t do that by having a service people pay for.” I suggest that Facebook’s users are paying, just with their attention and their personal information instead of with cash. A publicist changes the subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contrast this passage from earlier in the piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the hardest part is persuading the cell-phone companies to offer the content for free. The idea is that they should make the app available as a loss leader, and once customers see it (inside Facebook they talk about people being “exposed to data”), they’ll want more and be willing to pay for it. In other words, data is addictive, so you make the first taste free.</p>
  
  <p>This part is crucial. It’s not enough for the app to work—the scheme has to replicate itself virally, driven by cell-phone companies acting in their own self-interest. It’s a business hack as much as it is a technical one. Before Zambia, Facebook tried a limited run in the Philippines with a service provider called Globe, which reported nearly doubling its registered mobile data-service users over three months. There’s your proof of concept.</p>
  
  <p>The more test cases Facebook can show off, the easier it will be to persuade telcos to sign on. The more telcos that sign on, the more data Facebook compiles and the stronger its case gets. Eventually the model begins to spread by itself, region by region, country by country, and as it replicates it draws more and more people online. “Each time we do the integration, we tune different things with the operator and it gets better and better and better,” Zuckerberg says. “The thing that we haven’t proven definitely yet is that it’s valuable for them to offer those basic services for free indefinitely, rather than just as a trial. Once we have that, we feel like we’ll be ready to go around to all the other operators in the world and say, This is definitely a good model for you. You should do this.” (There’s a quiet arrogance to it, as there is to a lot of what Facebook does. Facebook is basically saying, Hey, third-world cell-phone operators, by the way, your business model? Let us optimize it for you.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Zuckerberg&rsquo;s case is that internet service is free&hellip;<em>for now</em>. People will somehow find a way to pay for it later as the internet opens more opportunities for people over time. Eventually, Facebook will be the only thing that&rsquo;s free, and it will operate in the same way it does in industrialized world with all of it&rsquo;s pitfalls and criticisms.</p>

<p>Apple creates products and sells them to customers all over the world. You pay money, you get an Apple product. That&rsquo;s it. <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/" target="_blank">Some of those profits help even fight AIDS</a>. Back in 2011, Tim Cook <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/113139/how-apple-could-really-change-the-world/" target="_blank">detailed</a> a program to make products last longer, so they can be traded-in an utilized for third world countries.

<p>That&rsquo;s an honest relationship with the customer. For as long as Facebook gives away a service in exchange for information that&rsquo;s handed over to advertisers, I can&rsquo;t help but question their intentions.</p>

      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/us/justice-dept-inquiry-finds-abuses-by-cleveland-police.html?_r=0">Cleveland Police Abuse Pattern Cited by Justice Department</a><br/><p>NY Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Cleveland abuses highlighted by Mr. Holder included many that have caused friction with the police in minority communities around the country. Those include excessive use of deadly force like shootings and using weapons to hit suspects on the head; the “unnecessary, excessive or retaliatory use of less lethal force” involving Tasers, chemical spray and fists; excessive force against mentally ill people; and tactics that have escalated encounters into confrontations where use of force became inevitable.</p>
  
  <p>“Cleveland officers are not provided with adequate training, policy guidance, support and supervision,” the Justice Department concluded in its report.</p>
  
  <p>As a result of the investigation, the city has agreed to work toward a settlement with the Justice Department known as a consent decree that will tighten and govern policies on use of force and subject the police to oversight by an independent monitor. Consent decrees in other cities, including Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans and Albuquerque, were put into effect after investigations into questionable police violence and other abusive practices.</p>

  <p>Today, it is announcing that it has raised another $75 million, in large part to expand its manufacturing capacity and buy new equipment for a new production hall and new machinery to help it test and create new products. This is rare, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a recent convert to Harry&rsquo;s, and so far I&rsquo;m very pleased with the service. Quality good, conveniently delivered, all while being cheaper than the well-established competition.</p>

Now, a poor Moroccan kid in France is much more likely to move into the middle class than a child born into a poor family in Mississippi. (The US and Britain are usually seen as having the lowest intergenerational social mobility of the countries of Europe and North America.

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s pretty similar in that regard to Twitch, the game-streaming site acquired by Amazon for $1.1 billion in August. But there’s one big difference: Currently, Steam Broadcasting requires that both the broadcaster and the viewer opt in to the beta service from their account settings.</p>
  
  <p>Valve’s announcement of the beta emphasizes the one-to-one benefits of game streaming —such as demonstrating for a friend how to beat a tricky level or just showing off — but it will also be possible to broadcast to strangers. After one friend requests access to a game stream, broadcasters are given the choice to open it up to just that person, many friends, or all Steam users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first tendency is to compare it to Twitch, but I think we&rsquo;re better off comparing it to the built-in &ldquo;social spectating&rdquo; features on the Xbox One and PS4.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/12/02/apple-breaks-its-own-rulesto-fight-aids.html">Apple breaks its own rules...to fight AIDS.</a></h1>

      <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/12/01/app-store-rule-5-6">Apple breaks its own rules...to fight AIDS.</a><br/><p>If you&rsquo;ve opened the app store on any Mac or iOS device, you&rsquo;ve notice that Apple is in the middle of a massive campaign to honor World AIDS Day. This is on the Apple Store website at the time of writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re contributing a portion of the proceeds from every product, accessory, and gift card we sell at the Apple Retail Store and Apple Online Store to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. And when you buy or make in-app purchases in any of the special Apps for (RED) through December 7, we’ll donate 100 percent of the proceeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple also decided to send out a push notification to get the word out. It simply reads &ldquo;Get great apps and help (RED) fight AIDS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marco Arment argues that by doing so, Apple is technically breaking its own App Store rules.</p>

<p>He wrote his today <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/12/01/app-store-rule-5-6" target="_blank">in a blog post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of the cause, this is clearly a promotion, will annoy thousands or millions of people, and is in direct violation of the least-enforced rule in the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s right that it&rsquo;s clearly a promotion. He&rsquo;s probably right that it&rsquo;s a violation of a poorly-enforced rule in the App Store. However, I&rsquo;m not sure a lot of people are going to be bothered by this.</p>

<p>After all, this is part of a campaign to fight AIDS, a truly terrible disease. If Apple does this sort of thing once a year, I don&rsquo;t see the need to make a huge fuss about it. If Apple did this weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, <em>then</em> I can maybe see the need for conversation.</p>

<p>A lot of people called Marco out via Twitter. Some agreed with him, while others, including myself, all thought Apple was doing this for a good cause.</p>

<p>This is where, I think, his argument got truly off track:</p>

<center>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>It wouldn’t be OK for someone to suddenly walk into your house to tell you about their charity.</p>— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/539589862752796676" target="_blank">December 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></center>

<p>This is just a poor argument. A person walking into your house is in no way comparable to an unwanted push notification. One of these things is a crime, while the other is <em>maybe</em> annoying to <em>some</em> people.</p>

<p>Apple probably does need to work on stopping apps from using push notifications to send advertisements and other forms of marketing, but I think Marco could have chosen a better path.</p>

<p>The photos show just how much the wrestling business has changed since then.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Byrne hasn’t been to watch or photograph wrestling since that time in the late 1980s. The sport, he said, was pulled from mainstream television around that time and, while it still exists today, it has never been quite as popular. Looking back on his images now, Byrne said he is sad that wrestling has moved out of small venues and that the sport has become influenced by the American model of “big names, glamour and glitz.”</p>
  
  <p>“I think it’s a great loss for small communities. When wrestling came to town, for that evening, once every few months, you could escape the hardships of life. You could totally immerse yourself in the moment in pure theater,” he said. “You could scream and shout at someone twice your size and get away with it. It was just great, clean fun.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When historians look at the history of the Web ten or twenty years from now, chances are they will point to Firefox as one of the most important products of the last ten years. But right now, it’s hard not to look at Firefox and worry a little bit about its future.</p>
  
  <p>At the height of its success, around 2010/11, Firefox owned more than a quarter of the browser market in the U.S. and almost a third in Europe. Today, those numbers are much lower in most regions (though Germans still love Firefox more than any other browser). The exact numbers always depend on who you ask, but the trend is the same everywhere — and it’s not looking good for Mozilla’s browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when Firefox was a revelation. In roughly 2005, I was using a Dell tower with a Celeron processor and it was brutally slow. I suffered for over year before I discovered that other browsers existed and Firefox was top of the heap. It wasn&rsquo;t long until I realized that it was (and still is) <em>miles</em> better than Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Firefox is still a good browser, but so is Chrome. On my Mac with Yosemite, I&rsquo;m hooked on the redesigned Safari. Still, I hope Firefox stays alive for all those Windows users looking for a decent way to surf the internet.</p>

<p>CM Punk breaks his silence over why he left the WWE earlier this year, and the details are earth shattering. This will definitely blow your mind if your a wrestling fan, but you&rsquo;ll certainly be taken aback even if you&rsquo;ve never watched two men lock up in the squared circle.</p>

<p>Punk, it appears, leaves no stone unturned, and while this is all his perspective, there&rsquo;s currently no reason to believe it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

<p>I would argue that this could very well be a landmark moment for the podcasting medium, given the potential fallout inside the WWE.</p>

      <a href="https://storify.com/betakateenin/white-people-riots">White people rioting over stupid shit</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;ve heard people complain about how &ldquo;they&rdquo;, aka black people, are behaving in light of the situation Ferguson. The provided link is a solid retort.</p>

<p>One thing, though: in many instances, including Ferguson, there may be dozens or even hundreds of people behaving badly during protests. Just remember that they&rsquo;re vastly outnumbered by people who are doing the right thing.</p>

  <p>WASHINGTON, DC – The National Bar Association is questioning how the Grand Jury, considering the evidence before them, could reach the conclusion that Darren Wilson should not be indicted and tried for the shooting death of Michael Brown. National Bar Association President Pamela J. Meanes expresses her sincere disappointment with the outcome of the Grand Jury’s decision but has made it abundantly clear that the National Bar Association stands firm and will be calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue federal charges against officer Darren Wilson. “We will not rest until Michael Brown and his family has justice” states Pamela Meanes, President of the National Bar Association.</p>

      <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">Because Reading is Fundamental</a><br/><p>Jeff Atwood writes his thoughts on how websites can help people read articles before diving into the hell of the comments section. First, he makes a fabulous comment that everyone should take not of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find that the value of conversations has little to do with how much people are talking. I find that too much talking has a negative effect on conversations. Nobody has time to listen to the resulting massive stream of conversation, they end up just waiting for their turn to pile on and talk, too. The best conversations are with people who spend most of their time listening. The number of times you&rsquo;ve posted in a given topic is not a leaderboard; it&rsquo;s a record of failing to communicate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The list of closures affects schools that are rich and poor, black and white, emblematic of districts that are more segregated today than before Brown vs. Board of Education. Indeed, after this summer’s shooting and ensuing protests, two prominent scholars on race and education called Ferguson “a reality check for anyone ignoring the changing racial demographics of our suburbs and the need to work toward sustainable, racially diverse suburban communities and schools.”</p>
  
  <p>That makes the closure all the more despairing. Why fret over big-box stores staying open but not our schools? The National Guard arrived in Ferguson last night presumably to keep calm in the streets. Would it not send an even more powerful message for those officers to guarantee the safe passage of thousands of children to school?</p>

      <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">Winding down my Twitter apps</a><br/><p>Manton Reece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week, Twitter announced that they’ve expanded their search index to include the full history of tweets going back to 2006. I was thrilled by this upgrade to the Twitter service. That the search was so limited for so long was the primary reason I built Tweet Library and Watermark to begin with. Unfortunately, this functionality is only for the official Twitter apps. It will not be made available to third-party developers.</p>
  
  <p>It’s time for me to wind down development on my Twitter-related apps. I’ll continue to sell Tweet Library through the end of 2014, then remove it from the App Store. Watermark will also shut down at that time. Because all the tweets stored in Watermark are public tweets (by design it never supported DMs or protected accounts), I will attempt to make the entire Watermark database archive of millions of tweets available publicly. Existing customers can also sync tweets and collections to Dropbox for personal archiving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s sad. So many developers <em>want</em> to serve the needs of Twitter’s users, but it’s becoming more and more obvious that Twitter prefers to serve the needs of it’s shareholders.</p>

<p>To be fair, Twitter’s official app has gotten better, but it simply is not good enough. Now, more than ever, I wish I could find a social network that aimed to be part of the solution, and not that problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “USA Freedom Act” was supported by an unusual coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans concerned about Americans’ privacy, but failed 58 to 42, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move ahead.</p>
  
  <p>The measure is unlikely to become law anytime soon, as Republicans will hold a majority of seats in the Senate after Jan. 1.</p>
  
  <p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, the future Senate Majority Leader, came out strongly against the bill in a Senate speech on Tuesday morning, concerns matched by several hawkish Republicans including former government officials.</p>
  
  <p>“If our aim is to degrade and destroy ISIL, as the president has said, then that’s going to require smart policies and firm determination. At a minimum, we shouldn’t be doing anything to make the situation worse,” McConnell said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s a terrible name for a bill.</p>

<p>Second, it would seem like a surprising move for Republicans to kill such a bill, but clearly they&rsquo;ll kill anything in the name of &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>Together, the U.S. and China account for more than a third of global greenhouse emissions, and today, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-obama-xi-climate-change-20141111-story.html" target="_blank">they’ve agreed to significant cuts</a>. The deal has negotiators hoping it will inspire similar commitments from other countries.</p>
<p>The details: President Obama agreed that the U.S. would cut net greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% by 2025, doubling its current pace of carbon reduction. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a stepped-up time frame for carbon reduction and for increasing the country’s use of nuclear, wind and solar energy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ars Technica:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarkeesian took to her Twitter account to confirm that cancellation, stating “police wouldn’t take steps to prevent concealed firearms at the event” and “requested pat downs or metal detectors after mass shooting threat, but because of Utah’s open carry laws, police wouldn’t do firearm searches.” As Sarkeesian noted earlier, this speaking event would have been the third in which she had been anonymously threatened with violence in an attempt to prevent her from speaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s embarrassing to live in a country where adolescent gun rights ideologies can prevail over the basic freedom of speech and expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One doesnt trump the other.  The are both rights we are granted among others.  Give up one, give them all up.  Read the history of America, its Constitution, Bill of Rights and the Federalist papers. Then maybe you will get a perspective why the founding fathers thoughts all these rights are important.</p></blockquote>

<p>The open carry laws, not the second amendment, are what allowed the threat of a mass shooting to prevail over an individual&rsquo;s right to speak. Open carry laws as they pertain to the second amendment are open to interpretation.</p>

<p>On &ldquo;give up one, give them all up&rdquo;: Allowing open carry laws to &ldquo;trump&rdquo; the right to speech is, based on your own argument, allowing the second amendment to trump the first amendment. It&rsquo;s rather troubling that you&rsquo;ve read the constitution, bill of rights, and federalist papers, and then molded the writing to fit your ideologies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s extremely hard for me to understand Amazon’s consumer hardware strategy. Usually, when a company has a strategy I don’t understand, I can look deeper, ask employees, or analyze the greater market to get a faint idea of what is driving the company’s behavior. But with Amazon, I can’t. There is simply no rational explanation for its products. The only thing I can come up with is this: Amazon continues to make hardware because it doesn’t know that it sucks, and it has a fundamentally flawed understanding of media. With Amazon.com, it can heavily and successfully promote and sell its products, giving it false indicators of success.</p>
  
  <p>It’s an echo chamber. They make a product, they market the product on Amazon.com, they sell the product to Amazon.com customers, they get a false sense of success, the customer puts the product in a drawer and never uses it, and then Amazon moves on to the next product. Finally, with the Fire Phone, customers have been pushing back. You can’t buy a phone and put it in a lonely drawer, never to use it again, like you would with a Fire Tablet. You can’t dupe your customers by selling them a shitty phone, because a phone becomes a part of its user’s identity.</p>

  <p>That said, this move smacks of desperation. Because Microsoft’s shifted from a strategy of “if you want to use our apps, you have to pay for a subscription” to “okay, you can use most of the common features for free, but we hope you’ll upgrade for fancier features.” Clearly, Redmond’s hoping that first, free taste will be enough to get you hooked. Then again, if Microsoft’s subscription strategy was succeeding, it wouldn’t be making this change.</p>

  <p>At the federal level, Congress imposed mandatory minimum sentences for narcotics offenses, gun offenses, child pornography offenses, and much else besides. Sometimes, moreover, these mandatory sentences were required to be imposed consecutively. For example, federal law prescribes a mandatory minimum of ten years’ imprisonment, and a maximum of life imprisonment, for participating in a conspiracy that distributes five kilograms or more of cocaine. But if the use of a weapon is involved in the conspiracy, the defendant, even if she had a low-level role in the conspiracy, must be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of fifteen years’ imprisonment, i.e., ten years on the drug count and five years on the weapons count. And if two weapons are involved, the mandatory minimum rises to forty years, i.e., ten years on the drug count, five years on the first weapons count, and twenty-five years on the second weapons count—all of these sentences being mandatory, with the judge having no power to reduce them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Missouri voters didn&rsquo;t think twice about approving <a href="http://www.kshb.com/news/political/missouri-voters-approve-child-abuse-proposal" target="_blank">a constitutional amendment</a> that allows &ldquo;previous allegations of criminal acts to be used against people facing sex-related charges involving victims under 18 years old.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know that much of the world relies on a combination of Dropbox and Microsoft Office to get work done. In fact, Dropbox is home to over 35 billion Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. That’s why we’re partnering with Microsoft to help you do more on your phones, tablets, and the web. Soon you’ll be able to access your Dropbox directly from Office apps, and edit Office files from the Dropbox app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart move from both parties involved, especially for enterprise and school environments that for some reason still haven&rsquo;t gotten away from Office.</p>

  <p>MOSCOW (AP) — A two-meter statue of an iPhone on a university campus in St. Petersburg has been taken down in response to last week&rsquo;s announcement by the CEO of Apple that he is gay.</p>
  
  <p>In a statement, ZEFS, which according to its website owns construction, advertising, and finance enterprises in St. Petersburg, describes Tim Cook&rsquo;s revelation &ldquo;a public call to sodomy.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>ZEFS said Monday it was taking down the statue because it violated Russia&rsquo;s controversial law protecting minors from homosexual propaganda. The law has been condemned by critics as a means of repressing sexual minorities in the country.</p>

  <p>The UN has been trying to deal with this issue since 1992, when the Earth Summit in Rio agreed a non-binding treaty to reduce greenhouse gases, which resulted in emissions rising. In 1997, the Kyoto treaty bound countries to reduce pollution—but the US never ratified the treaty, and China, India, and others were exempt on account of their relative lack of prosperity. The Copenhagen summit in 2009 was intended to take Kyoto a step further, with more binding targets, but collapsed in acrimony as the US led five nations in blocking a deal. And in  2012 in Doha, everyone agreed that it was time for an agreement—to enter force in 2020.</p>

      <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/tim-cook-isnt-gay-for-you-30353288/">Tim Cook isn’t gay for you</a><br/><p>Excellent piece from Craig Davies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suggestion from some has been that Cook&rsquo;s sexuality is a non-issue. I suppose, if that really were the case, today&rsquo;s openness - and the CEO&rsquo;s sacrifice of privacy - is similarly for naught. Personally, though, I think there&rsquo;ll be more than one struggling person who gains strength from his openness. The fact that Cook is now the sole openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list suggests that, contrary to the commentary, we&rsquo;re not yet at a place where it simply &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; any more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Confirming its own estimates from earlier this month, Samsung announced tonight that it accumulated an operating profit of $3.9 billion in Q3. That’s not a bad haul for most companies in the July to September period, but last year Samsung proudly celebrated a record profit of $9.6 billion and now it’s down to less than half that. Now the company is breaking down the reasons behind the drop, and everything starts with the flagship Galaxy S smartphones. Reuters notes that phones drove its growth over the last couple of years, but profits in that area dropped from 6.7 trillion Korean won last year, to 1.75 trillion in the same period this year.</p>

  <p>As tweeted by PCalc developer James Thomson today, he will be forced to remove the app&rsquo;s iOS 8 widget.

  <p>Getting an accurate read on how well the new generation of consoles is selling is a difficult job, and it&rsquo;s complicated by sporadic and sometimes vague numbers provided by the console makers themselves.

<p>Baybayan is part of a massive labor force that handles “content moderation”—the removal of offensive material—for US social-networking sites. As social media connects more people more intimately than ever before, companies have been confronted with the Grandma Problem: Now that grandparents routinely use services like Facebook to connect with their kids and grandkids, they are potentially exposed to the Internet’s panoply of jerks, racists, creeps, criminals, and bullies. They won’t continue to log on if they find their family photos sandwiched between a gruesome Russian highway accident and a hardcore porn video. Social media’s growth into a multibillion-dollar industry, and its lasting mainstream appeal, has depended in large part on companies’ ability to police the borders of their user-generated content—to ensure that Grandma never has to see images like the one Baybayan just nuked.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how much more worthy of his care and affection is Siri, with her soothing voice, puckish humor and capacity for talking about whatever Gus’s current obsession is for hour after hour after bleeding hour? Online critics have claimed that Siri’s voice recognition is not as accurate as the assistant in, say, the Android, but for some of us, this is a feature, not a bug. Gus speaks as if he has marbles in his mouth, but if he wants to get the right response from Siri, he must enunciate clearly. (So do I. I had to ask Siri to stop referring to the user as Judith, and instead use the name Gus. “You want me to call you Goddess?” Siri replied. Imagine how tempted I was to answer, “Why, yes.”)</p>
  
  <p>She is also wonderful for someone who doesn’t pick up on social cues: Siri’s responses are not entirely predictable, but they are predictably kind — even when Gus is brusque. I heard him talking to Siri about music, and Siri offered some suggestions. “I don’t like that kind of music,” Gus snapped. Siri replied, “You’re certainly entitled to your opinion.” Siri’s politeness reminded Gus what he owed Siri. “Thank you for that music, though,” Gus said. Siri replied, “You don’t need to thank me.” “Oh, yes,” Gus added emphatically, “I do.”</p>

  <p>If I had to guess, you’ll have a long wait, and they won’t work with any Mac sold to date.</p>
  
  <p>Panel yields may be tight for a while, and external displays are a low priority for Apple. The original 27” iMac’s groundbreaking LCD panel wasn’t available in an external display from Apple for almost a year after its release. But that’s not the biggest problem.</p>
  
  <p>Pushing this many pixels requires more bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.2 offers, which is what Thunderbolt 2 ports use for outputting video signals. (I wrote about this a few times.) Doing it right will require waiting until DisplayPort 1.3 in Thunderbolt 3 on Broadwell’s successor, Skylake, which isn’t supposed to come out for at least another year — and Intel is even worse at estimating ship dates than I am, so it’s likely to be longer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, this display is an iMac—and not an external display. But it makes sense, in a way. Getting this much video data out of a computer and into a monitor can be hard. What makes it easier is if you just connect the computer directly to the display and create a single product that’s got the computer and display integrated. You know, like a Retina iMac. And so here we are… at least for now.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/10/17/the-imac-with-retina-5k-display-came-first.html">The iMac with Retina 5K Display came first</a></h1>

      <p>Apple finally unveiled the fabled retina iMac. It&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/specs/" target="_blank">iMac with Retina 5K display</a>, featuring a 5120x2880 resolution. It&rsquo;s insane, and it starts $2499. $500 less than the Mac Pro&rsquo;s starting price.</p>

<p>Along with the amazing display is the iMac many of us know and love. I have a 2011 base 21.5&quot; model and it&rsquo;s the best computer that I&rsquo;ve ever owned. I&rsquo;ve always felt that the 27-inch display was a little too big for me, so I went with the &ldquo;small&rdquo; one and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>

<p>On today&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeLzZxSkmOs" target="_blank">5by5 Special</a>, Dan Benjamin, Victor Agreda Jr. and Adam Cristianson discuss the newest iMac, and ponder why Apple didn&rsquo;t come out with a new Retina Display alongside the all-in-one. One argument centers around the fact that Apple has a lot of Mac Pro owners clamoring for precisely that, but for whatever reason, it&rsquo;s not available. There&rsquo;s a group of customers standing with their wallets open, ready to throw money at the company, yet Apple is still holding off.</p>

<p>I think Apple&rsquo;s reasoning fairly simple. It probably costs a lot of time, money and resources to make this display. Apple wanted to get it to market as soon as possible, and the tech was there at a price they could handle; but at 27-inches, they probably had to choose between putting it atop the iMac lineup, or ushering in a new era of killer external displays.</p>

<p>My theory, based on absolutely nothing, is that Apple engineers and executives faced on simple question: <em>How best can we show this amazing display to the world for the first time?</em></p>

<p>Have you ever seen a Mac Pro sitting inside an Apple Store? It looks amazing, for sure, but it&rsquo;s usually setting there alone while a huge crowd pokes around on iMacs and MacBooks. They&rsquo;ll marvel at the sheer size of the 27-inch iMac before they even notice the little black trashcan. They&rsquo;ll also marvel at the Macbook Pro with Retina Display. They might even pick it up to marvel at how Apple could possibly fit so much power and beauty in such a small and light package.</p>

<p>Now, those same people can walk up to an unassuming 27-inch iMac at the corner of the display table. They&rsquo;ll turn it on, and suddenly this incredible Retina 5K display lights up in front of them. They may not buy this particular model. Not yet. But now, it&rsquo;s on their mind. And it will stay there, because as <a href="http://macsparky.com" target="_blank">David Sparks</a> said a time or two, if you look at a Mac with a Retina Display, it could very well spoil every display you&rsquo;ll ever lay your eyes on. It really is that good (I&rsquo;m clearly paraphrasing).</p>

<p>If Apple would have first shipped a 27-inch Retina 5K Display and plugged it into a display Mac Pro, a vast majority of current and existing customers simply wouldn&rsquo;t notice. It would have never piqued their interest.</p>

<p>Now obviously, a $2,500 computer is clearly marketed for power users. Apple surely knew this. They probably also thought,  <em>Why have a $3000+ computer alongside an approx. $2000 display, when we can make a separate $2500+ computer that fits nearly every need of nearly every customer on Earth?</em></p>

<p>The Mac Pro is great and all, but why buy it when you can spec out a killer iMac with a 27-inch Retina 5K display. Mac Pro users have their needs, and they will surely get an Apple display of their own someday. For now, there&rsquo;s far more business that can be done with a killer iMac.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty mind-blowing&hellip;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple SIM gives you the flexibility to choose from a variety of short-term plans from select carriers in the U.S. and UK right on your iPad. So whenever you need it, you can choose the plan that works best for you—with no long-term commitments. And when you travel, you may also be able to choose a data plan from a local carrier for the duration of your trip.</p>

  <p>Facebook will determine what constitutes a disaster worthy of a check-in by communicating with local authorities and experts, says Marcy Scott Lynn, global policy programs manager at Facebook. Safety Check has a few added elements — for example, you can check in for a Friend, and Facebook will ask you to check in if it sees you are traveling in a compromised area — but for the most part, Safety Check is intended for sharing one simple status: Yes, I’m fine.</p>

  <p>I’m not going to go into the deep, murky and often truly horrendous GamerGate controversy — the best explanation of the story thus far comes from Deadspin’s Kyle Wagner. What I am going to do is ask, what will it take for explicit threats to be taken seriously, for decisive action to be taken to protect people from gun violence? That’s actually a trick question. Because given what we already know from what we’ve experienced repeatedly in our country and from the persistent, tenacious hold that the gun lobby has on it, the answer is: We already have a body count, and nothing’s changing.</p>
  
  <p>You know how long it’s been since a man with a gun and a desire to punish women went out and killed a bunch of people near a school? Less than five months.

      <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/">Google unveils Nexus 9, Nexus 6</a><br/><p>Just a day ahead of Apple&rsquo;s iPad announcement that just leaked out everywhere on accident, Google unveiled updates to its Nexus line. It includes a 9-inch table, a 6-inch phone, and a Roku/Apple TV-like player thing.</p>

<p>I really like the tan color offered up on the back of the Nexus 9, while Motorola is absolutely killing it with its hardware design. I&rsquo;m surprised Google didn&rsquo;t announce these with at least a little bit of fan-fare.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also curious to see where the phone-size race ends up. Google&rsquo;s flagship phone now comes in one size, a whopping 6-inches. I&rsquo;m considering buying the iPhone 6 Plus, but I&rsquo;m not sure I can deal with 5.5-inches on a daily basis. I could really use the battery life and the improved two-handedness, but where in the world would I put it?</p>

<p>With the Nexus 6, Motorola has done a great job at taming the bezels to make the phone as small as possible, but there&rsquo;s no question that this is a (another) massive phone.</p>

      <a href="http://m.tuaw.com/2014/10/13/fbi-director-thinks-apples-data-encryption-is-too-secure/?ncid=rss_truncated">FBI director thinks Apple's data encryption is too secure</a><br/><p>Mike Weiner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem, of course, is that if a system like iOS is capable of being breached by an government agency, it is also feasible that an individual with less noble intentions could do the same. When a company like Apple pushes for greater data security, it isn&rsquo;t doing so to protect criminals, it&rsquo;s doing so to protect the 99% of its users who aren&rsquo;t criminals. Whether sacrificing the privacy of those 99% in order to catch the real &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; is worth it will continue to be debated for a long, long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be no debate. Punishing &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; based on the actions of the fringe is a poor class control tactic in elementary school. To do so at the level the FBI is suggesting is simply reprehensible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My initial set of reviews put the iPhone 6 on top, and the 6 Plus as a close second; further testing suggests they might actually be better characterized as reversed in order – the 6 Plus ends up being a better mobile computing device for my everyday use habits, even if it isn’t necessarily as mobile as its other new companion. Sure, it doesn’t fit quite as nicely in the skinny jeans I generally favor, but it still fits, and it’s a much better device for typing out a post on the go, if I end up needing to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel myself leaning towards the 6 Plus as my next phone, but as Etherington mentions later on, this weeks presumed iPad announcement will be very interesting in light of the 6 Plus, and there&rsquo;s no way I buy anything until Apple plays its hand.</p>

      <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/indigenous-people-day-replaces-columbus-seattle-26005980">Seattle to Celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day</a><br/><p>As Phuong Le writes, some disagree with the change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Columbus Day is a federal holiday that commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus, who was Italian, in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492. It&rsquo;s not a legal state holiday in Washington.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t argue with the idea of Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Day. We do have a big problem of it coming at the expense of what essentially is Italian Heritage Day,&rdquo; said Ralph Fascitelli, an Italian-American who lives in Seattle, speaking outside the meeting.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;This is a big insult to those of us of Italian heritage. We feel disrespected,&rdquo; Fascitelli said. He added, &ldquo;America wouldn&rsquo;t be America without Christopher Columbus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguing what Columbus Day &lsquo;essentially&rsquo; is or isn&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s not a good enough reason to oppose the change. If you want an Italian Heritage Day, that&rsquo;s an entirely worthwhile endeavor. Such heritage can be honored much more effectively when not naming it after a genocidal maniac.</p>

      <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2j2ut8/i_know_a_lot_of_people_on_rsoccer_dont_follow_mls/">The bonkers MLS season finale</a><br/><p>Ok here’s the deal:</p>

<p>As this Reddit thread points out, the next two weeks of the MLS regular season are going to feature some high drama. In the Western Conference, two teams are tied for first place with 60 points each. The teams are Seattle Sounders and LA Galaxy. For some reason, their next two scheduled games…are against each other!</p>

<p>On Sunday, Oct. 19, Seattle will travel to Los Angeles for a 7:30 p.m. CST game televised on ESPN2. On the next Sunday, Oct. 25, Los Angeles plays in Seattle’s, 1:30 p.m. CST at the Sounder’s massive CenturyLink field. For that game, the Sounders already planned<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/2j2vyw/seattle_sounders_and_la_galaxy_will_go_into_their/cl7wuzm" target="_blank">to open the entire stadium</a>, which could produce attendance records of over 60,000 people.</p>

<p>The MLS awards the Supporter’s Shield to the team with the best regular season record. One quick look at <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings" target="_blank">the standings</a> shows the Sounders and Galaxy are both fighting for the spot. Seattle leads by two wins, so if Los Angeles wins their next two games (against Seattle!), the Galaxy take home the silverware in dramatic fashion ahead of the playoffs.</p>

<p>All this gets even sweeter when you realize the matches will feature some of the most popular players in U.S. Soccer: Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan, just to name two. This is Dempsey’s first full season in the league after making waves in Europe, while Donovan, a national soccer hero, is playing his final season after announcing his retirement.</p>

<p>If there was ever a time to start watching top-flight domestic soccer, this is it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s a better way to use Columbus Day: Make kids go to school that day, as they already do in 27 states. Celebrate Columbus Day by encouraging teachers to talk about the complicated legacy of Columbus in American history (including the day&rsquo;s significance for Italian-Americans, who still faced discrimination themselves when it was established in 1937). Going to class on Columbus Day and talking about history makes the day a reason to explore America&rsquo;s past, not just an excuse for mattress sales. As it is now, it&rsquo;s not just a logistical headache for parents — it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity for real learning.</p>

  <p>A leaked internal Walgreens memo obtained by MacRumors suggests that Apple Pay will go live on Saturday, October 18. Apple Pay, of course, represents Apple&rsquo;s foray into the world of mobile payments. The service promises to be extremely secure and rather quick and easy to use. The number of merchants at launch will be relatively small (~220,000), but that figure is likely to mushroom in the coming months. Recall that all merchants who accept credit and debit cards will be incentivized to upgrade their POS machines to more modern models by October 2015.</p>

But it can also be worn in a shirt pocket, as a kind of lifelogger. A future software update will allow the Re to livestream video to Youtube. Its small size and discrete shape also raises questions about using the Re for secret recording for nefarious purposes. While the Re is recording video, there’s a hardwired LED on the front that will light up.</p>

<p>It costs $200, which might be a bit steep. Give it a year and I bet it drops down to $100. Till then, early adopters will have to find clear use case for it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, the big question for me in testing the iPhone 6 Plus was this: would it, in turn, allow me to leave my Note 3 at home? So far, the answer has been no, not quite &ndash; but it is good enough to have me thinking about carrying both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helps no one. The answer is either yes or no. &ldquo;Both&rdquo; is a cop-out. Maybe Stevens can afford to carry both, but basically every normal consumer can&rsquo;t do that.</p>

  <p>Usability is at the top of the list and carryability is second fiddle now, Android got there first, but Apple paved the way for it through user adoption of the platform.

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK Parliament passed the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Act_1829" target="_blank">Metropolitan Police Act in 1829</a>. The act was introduced by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel, who undertook a study of crime and policing, which resulted in his belief that the keys to building an effective police force were to 1) make it professional (most prior policing had been volunteer in nature); 2) organize as a civilian force, not as a paramilitary force; and 3) make the police accountable to the public. The Metropolitan Police, whose officers were referred to as &ldquo;bobbies&rdquo; after Peel, was extremely successful and became the model for the modern urban police force, both in the UK and around the world, including in the United States.</p>
  
  <p>At the heart of the Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s charter were a set of rules either written by Peel or drawn up at some later date by the two founding Commissioners: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policing-by-consent" target="_blank">The Nine Principles of Policing</a>. They are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/14/08/policing-by-consent" target="_blank">Click through to read all nine</a>. I&rsquo;m going to pick out two of them, adding my own emphasis to number 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start="6"><li><p>To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, <strong>and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.</p></li>

  <p>Ryan was working on his laptop in a McDonald&rsquo;s near the protests in Ferguson, Mo., when police barged in, armed with high-powered weapons, and began clearing the restaurant. Ryan photographed the intrusion, and police demanded his ID in response. Ryan, as is his right, declined to provide it.

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Ryan justified the use of repeated doses of the drugs by citing a state law authorizing “an intravenous injection of substance or substances in lethal quantity sufficient to cause death.”</p>
  
  <p>Medical experts said the amount of the drugs used in Mr. Wood’s execution was unprecedented and its effect unknown. Joel Zivot, an assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University Hospital, said there was inherent danger in repurposing drugs “designed to treat patients, to cure diseases,” because there was no dosage “indicated or prescribed as having the intent to kill.”</p>
  
  <p>“They’re making this up as they go along,” Dr. Zivot said in a telephone interview.</p>
  
  <p>Dr. Zivot said that midazolam acts “like a key in a lock,” attaching to a receptor in the body and causing sedation. Once the receptor is saturated, he said, “it doesn’t matter if you give the person 500 additional doses or five million doses. It won’t have any more effect.”</p>

  <p>However the declination can be overridden if a particular length numerical code is given to the cashier, which usually comes from the bank. When one of Parrish’s four dodgy debit cards (three Chase debit cards and one SunTrust card) was inevitably declined, he would explain to the cashier that he needs to call the bank and find out what’s going on.</p>
  
  <p>Parrish would then give the cashier a code from the ‘bank’ and the transaction would be authorized. How exactly did he know the code? Well the code can be any random assignment of numbers, so long as it’s a particular length. Parrish knew this and just made up the numbers on the spot and handed them over to the cashier.</p>
  
  <p>In a similar case earlier this year, the U.S Attorney’s Office in New Jersey admitted that: “it does not actually matter what code the merchant types into the terminal.  Any combination of digits will override the denial.  So long as the customer provides a fake authorization code and convinces the merchant to enter it into the terminal, the transaction will go through.”</p>

  <p>But I’ve reached the conclusion that 9 times out of 10, choosing to quit is more important than toughing it out.</p>
  
  <p>Quitting is a direct action that leads to a more thoughtful and efficient way of spending our limited resources. There’s value in choice, in quitting, and in accepting that neither is failure. Quitting is really just opening up to new, possibly unknown, opportunities. Yes, it could lead to everything going to shit, but if it’s already gone to shit, why not quit?</p>

  <p>She is bolstered, she says, by hard facts. A subscriber to AARP Magazine, she enjoys citing studies about health and longevity. A few years ago, after reading in a book that people who feel a strong sense of community have been proven to lead longer and happier lives, Bamford started working to overcome her natural shyness and fear of interaction by saying hello to her neighbors in Eagle Rock, a diverse and partly gentrified area on the northeastern edge of Los Angeles. She bought a park bench and had it installed on the median strip in front of her house. She then spray-stenciled the words “Have a Seat!” on the sidewalk in front of it. To her delight, the bench is often occupied. “It’s like a bird feeder for humans,” she says.</p>

  <p>“So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and show their co-worker. The co-worker says: ‘Hey that’s great. Send that to Bill down the way.’ And then Bill sends it to George and George sends it to Tom. And sooner or later this person’s whole life has been seen by all of these other people. It’s never reported. Nobody ever knows about it because the auditing of these systems is incredibly weak. The fact that your private images, records of your private lives, records of your intimate moments have been taken from your private communications stream from the intended recipient and given to the government without any specific authorization without any specific need is itself a violation of your rights. Why is that in a government database?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Reuters) - A Malaysian airliner was brought down in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 295 people aboard and sharply raising the stakes in a conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow rebels that has set Russia and the West at daggers drawn.</p>
  
  <p>As the United States said the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was &ldquo;blown out of the sky&rdquo;, probably by a ground-launched missile, Ukraine and Russia traded accusations of blame, cranking up global pressure for a way out of a bloody local conflict that risks fueling a new Cold War.</p>
  
  <p>Ukraine accused pro-Moscow militants, aided by Russian military intelligence officers, of firing a long-range, Soviet-era SA-11 ground-to-air missile. Leaders of the rebel Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic denied any involvement and said a Ukrainian air force jet had brought down the intercontinental flight.</p>
  
  <p>But separatists have said that they took control of such a missile system last month and had used it to shoot down a Ukrainian military transport plane that was destroyed on Monday.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2013, the company generated $724.4 million in digital sales. That includes its Kongregate mobile gaming site, PC digital downloads, and in-store digital sales. For the first quarter of its fiscal 2014, GameStop noted that its digital revenue grew 9.5 percent year-over-year thanks in large part to currency cards for PS4 and Xbox One. GameStop is the biggest game-specific retailer in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crazy, right? Venture Beat breaks down how the brick and mortar store makes bank on digital sales:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GameStop has made a ton of effort to make sure it provides a satisfactory experience for customers looking to purchase digital goods. For games on Sony platforms, the process is simple. GameStop will sell people codes for specific DLC. Players can then take that home and enter it into their system, and the content automatically starts downloading. On Xbox systems, people can say they want certain DLC, and GameStop will sell them an Xbox Live gift card with money to get that expansion.</p>

  <p>Apple&rsquo;s iOS 7 adoption rate continues to grow, even as the release of iOS 8 approaches. As of yesterday, 90 percent of devices connected to the App Store are running iOS 7, according to new numbers posted on Apple&rsquo;s App Store developer support page.</p>
  
  <p>The new milestone, which comes 10 months after the operating system&rsquo;s original release, is a three percent increase from installation numbers of 87 percent back in April.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say it enough, the importance of OS adoption is critical to any mobile platform. Right now, a significant portion of iOS users are running the most secure and up-to-date version possible. That&rsquo;s good for everyone.</p>

I thought later that I left the game immediately after the tackle. I have no idea how I got to the changing rooms. I don&rsquo;t know anything else. In my head, the game starts from the second half.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Kramer&rsquo;s head injury on the biggest stage revived concerns about the way football deals with concussions. It was the latest in a series of head injuries at the World Cup that raised questions about the sideline medical checks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to multiple reports with knowledge of the situation, the Uruguay striker&rsquo;s contract with Barça will indeed have an &ldquo;anti-bite clause&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a conduct-based addition to his agreement, that states very clearly that another bite, or any conduct issue for that matter, will have harsh consequences for Luisito.</p>
  
  <p>The clause gives Barça the right to suspend Suárez themselves if another incident like the one involving Italy&rsquo;s Giorgio Chiellini happens again. Luisito can also be fined €5 million, among other penalties.</p>

  <p>But then we are talking about $799 for a base model machine and I still have to buy the type cover. So really $928 all in. All that for a device I may not even like.</p>
  
  <p>For less money I can buy an 11″ MacBook Air and install Windows on it (I already own Windows) in a native Bootcamp partition. Even if it turns out I don’t use Windows on the MacBook Air, I still have a MacBook Air. And I know the MacBook Air is outstanding with excellent battery life and something I will use with or without Windows on it.</p>

  <p>We used to buy movies on discs when we wanted to watch them, and now huge numbers of people stream them off the internet instead. It’s not hard to picture something similar happening with games, even if the logical endpoint would be the elimination of all local gaming hardware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really hoped for that future to be now. I envisioned the current crop of consoles to be small boxes connected wirelessly to the console makers proprietary controller. Obviously, we’re not there for various reasons: Technical limitations at the server side <em>and</em> the consumer side, along with the massive industry built around the sale of used video games.</p>

<p>One thing about the current console situation is true: Sony is totally killing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony and the Playstation 4 have a fairly firm grasp on the present. While the next holiday season could yet bring about change in this still-young war between the Xbox One and the PS4, it’s difficult to imagine that the currently dominant PS4 will be sitting anything less than pretty come 2015. It got there by recognizing that the console industry in 2014 doesn’t look all that different than it did in 2012: despite a larger focus on smaller titles and downloadable content, people are still mostly interested in big games, a decently powerful box that will play them, and not a whole lot else on top. And thus we have the PS4.</p>

<p>It’s an extraordinary machine.</p>

  <p>That Europe vs. South America final is instantly one of the most anticipated matches in recent memory, and Wednesday’s outcome is, according to tournament viewership figures, also a win for FIFA’s corporate partners and millions of American viewers.

<p>It&rsquo;s also good for history. Lionel Messi will finally have his chance to bring home the sport&rsquo;s greatest prize for his home country, just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona" target="_blank">Diego Maradona</a> did back in 1986&hellip;against West Germany.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/unread-review/" target="_blank">Macstories</a> tipped me off to this new app made by <a href="http://jaredsinclair.com" target="_blank">Jared Sinclair</a>, the same mind behind <a href="http://riposteapp.net" target="_blank">Riposte</a>, my favorite client for App.net.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Jared summed up why he sent Unread into a crowded market of RSS readers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let Unread be an opportunity to break away from your old reading habits. Let Twitter or App.net be the place for loud, busy feeds. Let RSS be the place where great independent writing thrives. Choose your favorite writers and read them closely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not heed this advice. I instead bought the app and loaded up my <a href="https://feedwrangler.net" target="_blank">Feed Wrangler</a> account without reform. I liked Unread very much at first, but it felt heavy and slow, so I ultimately found my way back to Reeder.</p>

<p>I must have signed up for Google Reader around 8 years ago; as I grew more and more interested in the mountain of tech blogs and automotive websites. Here was a way to bring it all together into one window on any computer, which is much better  clicking through my bookmarks toolbar over and over again.</p>

<p>As years passed, I accrued dozens of RSS subscriptions which leads to a problem: I <em>never</em> had less than “+1000” unread articles. Never. That number could have easily been 20,000. I’ll never know.</p>

<p>RSS ultimately became a way to tap and swipe through headlines. I would only read content from writers I was truly interested in, yet I was too scared to unsubscribed from RSS feeds out of some strange fear of “missing out”. Jared’s aforementioned blog post sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most RSS apps are patterned after email. Noisy parades of dots, dates, and tags trample over their screens. Their source lists look like overflowing inboxes instead of stately tables of contents. Toolbars bristling with options obscure the text. Putting it bluntly, using these apps feels like work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to get away from RSS several years ago, using only on Twitter lists to keep up with news. That didn’t work, because I really did miss out on the work of some of my favorite writers.</p>

<p>Then, two things happened: Jared spoke at length about this philosophy of Unread on <a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/102" target="_blank">CMD+Space</a>, and the World Cup started.</p>

<p>When the World Cup began, I started looking for ways to keep up with conversations over the tournament. For this, there’s no better place than Twitter to keep up, thus reminding me of all the Twitter lists I built years ago.</p>

<p>Another purpose for this: I hate spoilers. My job doesn’t allow me to watch all the soccer games that I want to see, especially during the winter.  Instead of following my favorite soccer feeds on Twitter, I can simply hide them in a list for later viewing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Unread and Jared’s explanation of its purpose, I’ve found room for both RSS feeds and Twitter lists. All of my favorite websites and feeds are all dumped into Twitter.  My favorite people get a follow, while important websites go into different lists titled “News,” “Tech,” “Blogs,” “Auto,” and “Football.”</p>

<p>As for RSS, I only subscribe to those who write what I want to read. The only writing I’ll see in Unread is from writers whose work  I’m anxiously waiting to read.</p>

<p>That’s where my RSS situation stands for now. There’s no way to know if I’ll stick with it, but either way, the RSS reform has been incredibly refreshing.</p>

<p>Ian Macintosh sums up the historic defeat well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When this World Cup began, Luiz Felipe Scolari&rsquo;s objective was to give the Brazilian supporters a performance that would make them forget forever what happened in 1950 in the Maracana. Well &hellip; mission accomplished. The Maracanazo, the shocking 2-1 defeat to Uruguay that cost Brazil the World Cup they assumed they&rsquo;d already won, is now only the second worst night in their history.</p>
  
  <p>That result was so stunningly awful that poets compared it to Hiroshima. Pele&rsquo;s father burst into tears in front of the television at full time. His young son, just 10 years old at the time, according to legend, comforted him and promised he would grow up and win the World Cup himself. Many of the players responsible for that failure were pariahs for decades afterward.</p>
  
  <p>What will become of these players?</p>

<p><a href="http://ift.tt/1x2tkWd" target="_blank">Witness accounts of the crash</a> are horrifying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we arrived at the summit, we spoke to a couple of photographers and riders who had seen the accident. It seems Goodin crossed the line and was still going at a decent clip when he raised his hand to celebrate making it to the top. He lost the front end on the unpaved section at the top and the bike veered right, launching Goodin over the edge, flipping him end-over-end into a patch of boulders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trevor Andrusko was at the summit working as a photographer, but now he&rsquo;s an unfortunate witness to a tragedy that he says could have been handled better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That&rsquo;s when I notice something else out of the ordinary. Chaos. Everyone up here is supposed to be up here. There are no fans; only media, officials, and competitors. But, people are shouting over the howling wind, arms are flailing, and panic is spreading. I begin to realize that there is no plan in place for something of this nature. I scan again. The only vehicles on the summit are a handful of private media cars and the two media shuttles. No ambulance, no safety truck, and no helicopter. Shit.</p>

<p>Goodin was 54-years-old.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year’s World Cup has featured some of the planet&rsquo;s greatest athletes performing seemingly impossible physical tasks. Bicycle kicks. Spectacular goals. Mind-bending saves. Displays of endurance, determination, and balletic grace. And, of course, turning to the left and folding your arms.</p>
  
  <p>It turns out that&rsquo;s surprisingly hard to ace on your first (and, presumably, only) try. Hundreds upon hundreds of millions of television viewers have watched players from all 32 teams botch this seemingly simple technique in the lineup presentations before each World Cup match. Nailing that turn and arm-fold is crucial, though: It’s the difference between looking like an ordinary, nice dude (like Japan&rsquo;s Atsuto Uchida) and an unlucky guy caught posing for his mug shot (like the United States’ Kyle Beckerman).</p>

  <p>This is a company that destroys the keys to its encryption hardware after setting them up in the data center, just in case an employee decides to sneak in a back door or hand the keys off to a government agency.

The results are staggering.</p>

<p>As someone who works in news, I&rsquo;m fascinated by the 2-story control room: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The control room was first built offsite, too, in a Los Angeles warehouse. Drake and his crew examined it thoroughly and tailored it with such detail that monitors were moved inches at a time during the drafting phase in California. Then it was all replicated to the same exact measurements months later and 5,000 miles away.</p>
  
  <p>The entire compound is powered by three giant generators that Drake calls “the beasts.” They are each twice the size of a meat freezer, and they hum quietly outside the control room in a space formerly reserved for a fish market. There’s also a fourth generator that powers the studio’s lights, a satellite truck connected to the IBC in case of emergency and bundles of cables winding down back corridors and around scaffolding, all just steps from the ocean.</p>

<p>ESPN has done a truly excellent job with this. It&rsquo;s a <em>temporary</em> set which looks infinitely better than it&rsquo;s <a href="http://ift.tt/1d5WSeT" target="_blank">new monstrosity in Bristol.</a></p>

<p>After 2014, Fox owns the rights to cover the next two World Cups. I hate its coverage of the Champions League, thus I am not looking forward to its World Cup coverage.</p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1oaMYvc" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

  <p>The new Photos app will also replace iPhoto, giving users a more seamless experience on Apple devices. The app will allow you to edit and search your entire photos library in the cloud on any of your Apple devices.</p>

  <p>A towering, 50-meter thick wall may sound like the fevered dream of isolationists bent on border control, but it just might be the solution to the midwest&rsquo;s tornado problems. University of Drextel physicist Rongjia Tao reckons that a trio of 1,000-foot high, 165-foot &ldquo;great walls&rdquo; could mitigate the worst natural weather of Tornado Alley &ndash; a loosely defined area that spans several states with high tornado risk. Tao compared Tornado Alley to a geographically similar area in China and concluded that the midwest suffered from more tornados primarily because it doesn&rsquo;t have east-west mountain ranges to weaken or block the weather patterns that form them. Now he&rsquo;s proposing that we build some.</p>

  <p>After recently prescribing the need for &lsquo;bitter medicine&rsquo; to resuscitate the ailing economy, the Narendra Modi government is, seemingly, working on contours of a social welfare healthcare project to sweeten the deal for the citizenry.

  <p>&ldquo;Fifty basic essential drugs address 75% of the healthcare needs of the majority, and we plan to make these available free to everyone, from birth to death,&rdquo; Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told HT.</p>
  
  <p>The programme will be rolled out in phases, beginning with select hospitals across India, with the objective of reaching every citizen.</p>
  
  <p>Once the rollout is complete, everyone will get these 50 medicines – that include traditional treatments for pain, infection, hypertension, diabetes, among others – complimentary on prescription at public hospitals and dispensaries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But here&rsquo;s the thing; Derek WAS meant to be different. He was meant to be marginalised by society. He was meant to draw assumptions by uncaring, thoughtless people who needed to label and pigeonhole individuals for their own peace of mind. He was meant to surprise and undermine stereotypes. And he was meant to look odd, speak funny, have bad hair and no fashion sense and not give a fuck about such things because he knew they weren&rsquo;t important. He knew what was really important. Kindness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Google trying to lure coders and designers to create more for its Android mobile software, Apple used its event to introduce new features to keep them in the fold. The iPhone maker showed improved methods for customers to find apps to download, a new programming language to create apps more quickly, and tools so the programs can work seamlessly together.</p>
  
  <p>The announcements represent Apple’s most comprehensive set of enhancements for developers since the company debuted its App Store nearly six years ago. For much of that period, the world’s most valuable company had a near lock on programmers as iPhones and iPads proliferated, giving developers a vast audience who could download their games and other widgets. Yet Google’s Android has since seized market share and others such as Facebook Inc. have rolled out tools to cater to developers.</p>

<p>Now-more so than ever-it can be argued that Apple is &ldquo;open&rdquo; in a way that Google could only dream of.</p>

  <p>The infrastructure changes in iOS 8 and Yosemite, though, will make a significant difference in how we use our devices. It’ll take a while for us to get used to them—old dogs, new tricks—and it’ll take a while for the apps we use to adjust themselves to the new possibilities, But Continuity, Extensions, iCloud Drive, the new Spotlight, and the API updates will make how we use our Apple devices next year distinctly different from how we use them this year.

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past nine years, Messi has led F.C. Barcelona to national and international titles while breaking individual records in ways that seem otherworldly. In 2012, he scored 91 goals in 69 games — a ridiculous number — for club and country, and he has been chosen by FIFA, soccer’s governing body, as the best player in the world an unprecedented four of the last five years. He is something of a freak, a blazing left-footer whose legs and spatial intuition operate at electrifying speed, and his performances in Europe have already put him, at age 26, on the short list of the greatest players ever.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, for all of that, Messi has never won widespread devotion in Argentina. The main resistance to him, beyond his uneven play for the national team thus far, is that he isn’t Argentine enough.</p>

<p>But enough of that. Let&rsquo;s talk about Craig Federighi. The Senior VP of Software Engineering was absolutely on fire.  Confident, (usually) Funny. Knowledgable. Whether true or not, it sure felt like he could have led the keynote all by himself.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m struck by the number of little pokes and jabs thrown Google&rsquo;s way throughout the presentation. Tim Cook and Federighi each made blatant jabs at Android fragmentation, but the right hook was the silent killer called Spotlight.</p>

<p>Apple wants you to use Spotlight for <em>all</em> searches, both local system searched <em>and</em> web searches. </p>

<p>It says so on the preview page<a href="http://ift.tt/19ZuKpL" target="_blank">the preview page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a new search window and rich, scrollable previews of your results, Spotlight makes it easier than ever to find things on your Mac. And now it finds information from Wikipedia, Bing, Maps, and other sources, too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: If you want to find something-no matter what it is-start with Spotlight, not Google. This is equally true for OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.</p>

<p>My favorite bit wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned in the keynote: You can change the default search engine to <a href="http://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/05/23/twitch-espn.html">Twitch ≠ ESPN</a></h1>

      <a href="http://www.codytucker.net/index/twitch-espn">Twitch ≠ ESPN</a><br/><p>In the latest episode of <a href="http://ift.tt/Rf4VMW" target="_blank">The Talk Show</a> John Gruber called Twitch &ldquo;The ESPN of video games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think I understand the point he&rsquo;s trying to make, but I must say there&rsquo;s really no real comparison between ESPN and Twitch.</p>

<p>ESPN is built as a 24-hour news network.  It features anchors, reporters, and commentators following a wide variety of sports, all packaged inside production values that rival or best news organizations around the world.  </p>

<p>Twitch has none of these features.  People simply stream gameplay from their consoles for the world to watch, often with their face in the corner of the screen via webcam and a chat window on the side.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="http://ift.tt/TmNVX6" target="_blank">Gruber</a> and many others are correct when saying there is absolutely nothing odd about Twitch&rsquo;s success.  Watching experts of their craft perform said craft is a phenomenon that is perhaps thousands of years old.</p>

<p>Twitch is <a href="http://ift.tt/1oJGJ3M" target="_blank">similar to ESPN</a> in that people go to the site to watch people play a game, but that&rsquo;s where the similarities end.  </p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s of better service to view Twitch in a lens that includes the likes of YouTube and other streaming video services.  Like YouTube, tens of millions of people flock to the site to watch people play video games (and countless other things).   </p>

<p>There are lots of &ldquo;YouTubers&rdquo; who now make a pretty penny off of videos that feature people playing their favorite games.  </p>

<p>The videos are supremely entertaining.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been in tears laughing at videos from  <a href="http://ift.tt/1ghluwQ" target="_blank">KSIOlajidebt</a> rage out after losing a hard fought battle on FIFA 14.  And you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about popular YouTubers without talking about <a href="http://ift.tt/1hwaajj" target="_blank">stampylonghead</a>.  His Minecraft channel is <a href="http://ift.tt/1g6OuXU" target="_blank">more popular than the Beiber.</a></p>

<p>Twitch fits in with YouTube perfectly because it provides that crucial live element.  Unlike recored and edited videos, Twitch lets you watch gaming wizards <em>right now</em>, and you can interact with them <em>right now</em>.  That&rsquo;s something that goes far beyond ESPN.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014/05/23/in-defense-of-podcasts.html">In defense of Podcasts</a></h1>

      <a href="http://www.codytucker.net/index/in-defense-if-podcasts">In defense of Podcasts</a><br/><p>I like podcasts.  <em>A lot</em>.</p>

<p>I could easily spend a vast majority of my waking hours listening to podcasts.  It&rsquo;s an incredible medium for ideas, arguments, and conversations.  </p>

<p>Most podcasts are free, and they&rsquo;re all available at a moments notice.  There are no &ldquo;Tonight at Ten!&rdquo; pitfalls associated with television.  If there is a topic for which you seek insight or perspective, you can probably find it in a podcast <em>right now</em>.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very important to me to have a good podcast app on all of my crucial devices: Mac, iPhone, and iPad. </p>

<p>Podcasts have been around for a long time, but thanks to incredible advances in technology over the past decade (i.e. the iPhone and the iPad), a growing list of developers are putting their spin on the podcast app, and many are very good. </p>

<p>The downside is that finding the right one can be difficult.  For the past year, my dock and home screens have been in constant flux thanks to changes in my podcast app of choice.  </p>

<p>But like a set of missing car keys, I may have finally found the right setup-one that&rsquo;s been in front of me all this time.  It&rsquo;s hidden inside iTunes, the app that helped bring the art of podcasts to the forefront of pop culture. </p>

<h2 id="instacastanddowncast">Instacast and Downcast</h2>

<p>For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve bounced between two of the front-runners in the podcast client market: <a href="http://ift.tt/A4Jukw" target="_blank">Instacast</a> and <a href="http://ift.tt/HPQGDQ" target="_blank">Downcast</a>.  </p>

<p>Instacast is without question the better looking app.  Since it was updated for iOS 7 last year, it&rsquo;s boasted a fantastic design for both iPhone and iPad.  The sync engine works nicely across devices, including the Mac.  </p>

<p>I used the Mac app while it was in Beta, but since it&rsquo;s release, I just never thought it was good enough to justify spending $20 on it.  Since I don&rsquo;t want to go &ldquo;all in&rdquo; with a podcast app without having a Mac client to sync with, Instacast has been off my radar for some time now.  </p>

<p>Downcast has its own Mac client, undercutting Instacast&rsquo;s offering by $10.  Yet, it has a similarly bland interface that troubles Instacast.  Yet, Downcast for iPhone and iPad  get a lot of things right.  In my experience, it&rsquo;s been incredibly reliable since its release and it works with my Alpine car stereo better than most apps in the piece. </p>

<p>Yet, for every time I come back to Downcasts, I eventually find myself looking at other options, mostly because it&rsquo;s just so <em>ugly</em>. Where Instacast and others soon to be mentioned are a pleasure to look it. Downcast is just blocky and heavy. Instacast is light and fun. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all about the looks, but an app that&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye ultimately defines the experience. As long as Downcasts keeps falling behind in this category, it may be forced off my list for good. </p>

<h2 id="pocketcasts">Pocket Casts</h2>

<p>For a short time, I used <a href="http://ift.tt/ZHlPa1" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a> thanks to recommendations from <a href="http://ift.tt/KhyFFF" target="_blank">The Sweet Setup</a>.  It&rsquo;s Stephen Hackett&rsquo;s pick as the podcaster you should go out and buy, and for good reason. </p>

<p>First, Pocket Casts looks fantastic.   Second, it&rsquo;s a universal iOS app. Meaning you pay once, and soon it&rsquo;ll be on both your iPhone and our iPad.  That&rsquo;s awesome.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pocket Casts isn&rsquo;t available for Mac.  There are still enough times when I want to set at my iMac and listen to podcasts without headphones.  Yes, I could theoretically plug my speakers into my iPhone&rsquo;s headphone jack, but why do that when there is good solution to my problem.  I&rsquo;ll get to that in a second.  </p>

<h2 id="podwrangler">Pod Wrangler</h2>

<p>But first&hellip;credit must be given to _David Smith for his work on Pod Wrangler.   I&rsquo;m a huge fan of _David&rsquo;s work.  His weather app <a href="http://ift.tt/1hsIkbS" target="_blank">Check the Weather</a> has had a near-permanent place on my home screen since it&rsquo;s release.  </p>

<p>When Google decided to kill Reader, _David stepped up to the plate and released <a href="http://ift.tt/ZjluFz" target="_blank">Feed Wrangler</a>, a truly excellent RSS service for which I&rsquo;m proud to be a paying customer. </p>

<p>Since I pay for his service, I figured it would only be right to at least try out his podcast offering.   I&rsquo;m glad I did, because it&rsquo;s fantastic.  It does everything I need a podcaster to do, but there are problems: There are no iPad or Mac versions and none in sight, while the app just doesn&rsquo;t get along well with my car stereo. </p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s good news:  Hidden in Feed Wranger&rsquo;s web interface is a section for podcasts that sync instantly with Pod Wrangler.  It even works on the iPad!  I used this method for quite some time, but unfortunately the experience with the web app is just not quite as good as the service now offered by Apple&rsquo;s Podcasts.</p>

<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>

<p>Apple caught a lot of heat when it essentially killed the &ldquo;podcasts&rdquo; section in iTunes.  Fears that the company had given up on the medium it helped create were eventually put to rest when it launched an app simply titled &ldquo;Podcasts.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s free on both iPhone and iPad, but since its release there was one big problem: It simply wasn&rsquo;t very good.  I tried using it on several occasion, but I always went back to one of the options mentioned above.  </p>

<p>All that may have changed for good last week.  <a href="http://ift.tt/1ouo4bZ" target="_blank">Apple updated iTunes</a>, bringing much better support for podcasts, all bundled in an app that&rsquo;s always running on my iMac. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not all, the Podcasts app for iOS also got some TLC.  An update brought improved support for show notes, but the iTunes update is a much bigger piece of the puzzle. </p>

<p>In the past, iTunes simply wasn&rsquo;t a great place to keep your podcasts, especially when there were so many great mobile apps that didn&rsquo;t sync with it.  </p>

<p>To Apple&rsquo;s credit, developers have worked (relatively) quickly to update the Podcasts app, and now iTunes boasts much of the functionality of Instacasts and Downcast.  </p>

<p>It would be nice if iTunes&rsquo; &ldquo;Podcasts&rdquo; section added buttons to scrub through episodes in 30 second to 2 minute increments ala Downcast, but I&rsquo;m learning that&rsquo;s a feature I can live without. </p>

<h2 id="thewildcards">The Wild Cards</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll stick with this setup forever.  Lots of people have heaped praise upon new apps like <a href="http://castro.fm/" target="_blank">Castro</a>, and everyone is eagerly awaiting Marco Arment&rsquo;s <a href="https://overcast.fm" target="_blank">Overcast</a>.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, both efforts possess the same problem. Neither developer have iPad or Mac versions in the works. So for me, if I want to have all of my podcasts synced across all of my devices, Apple&rsquo;s stock offerings do it with less fuss than any of its contemporaries. </p>

<p>The company that helped usher in the podcast revolution is actually working to push it forward.  That&rsquo;s a good thing. </p>

<p>As the Ars report states, several other products have allowed access to those services for a far lower point of entry throughout the past several years. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fueling the shift is the industry’s eagerness to distance itself from the government after last year’s disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance of online services. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google all are updating their policies to expand routine notification of users about government data seizures, unless specifically gagged by a judge or other legal authority, officials at all four companies said. Yahoo announced similar changes in July.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Justice Department worries the polices have the potential to undermine criminal investigations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These risks of endangering life, risking destruction of evidence, or allowing suspects to flee or intimidate witnesses are not merely hypothetical, but unfortunately routine,” department spokesman Peter Carr said, citing a case in which early disclosure put at risk a cooperative witness in a case. He declined to offer details because the case was under seal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The laws that govern protections afforded to our communications were written before e-mail, the Internet, and cloud computing came into wide use. Congress should amend ECPA [the Electronic Communications Privacy Act] to ensure the standard of protection for online, digital content is consistent with that afforded in the physical,&rdquo; the panel concluded.</p>
  
  <p>But it&rsquo;s uncertain whether Congress would actually amend ECPA, the privacy law in question that was <strong>adopted during the Reagan era</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Here&rsquo;s why: the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a reform measure last year requiring the authorities to obtain a probable-cause warrant to acquire cloud-based data—the same Fourth Amendment standard necessary to search the same material if it was on a hard drive in your house. However, an anonymous lawmaker or lawmakers has blocked the measure from going before the full Senate for a yes or no vote.</p>
  
  <p>And that&rsquo;s despite the unheard of support from the Justice Department saying it backs the Senate package to enhance the public&rsquo;s privacy protections.</p>

  <p>A spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights in Geneva said that the process to which Clayton Lockett was subjected on Tuesday may have amounted to &ldquo;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment&rdquo; under international human rights law, and may have violated the US constitution.</p>
  
  <p>Barack Obama admitted on Friday that the manner of Lockett&rsquo;s execution was &ldquo;deeply troubling&rdquo; and said he had asked the US attorney general, Eric Holder, to provide a review of the issues raised by it. &ldquo;I do think as a society we have to ask ourselves some difficult questions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  
  <p>A timeline published by the state of Oklahoma on Thursday showed that medical staff could not find a suitable vein on any of his limbs in which to inject the lethal drugs intended to kill him, and had to use his groin instead, which they covered, to prevent that area of his body from being seen by witnesses.</p>

This was mostly because of an uncomfortable interaction with a man asking for money for which I was took young to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and walk away.  </p>

<p>Instead I tried to be nice, but some beggars on Beale Street are extremely persistent; especially to the nice early-20&rsquo;s kids.  A security guard eventually intervened, saying he had watched us on cameras as we walked down the block with a stranger asking for cash.  If I remember correctly, he firmly told us to never give them money. </p>

<p>Late last year, I made two trips to Memphis after a lengthy hiatus.  I love it.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind living there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The open office was originally conceived by a team from Hamburg, Germany, in the nineteen-fifties, to facilitate communication and idea flow. But a growing body of evidence suggests that the open office undermines the very things that it was designed to achieve. In June, 1997, a large oil and gas company in western Canada asked a group of psychologists at the University of Calgary to monitor workers as they transitioned from a traditional office arrangement to an open one. The psychologists assessed the employees’ satisfaction with their surroundings, as well as their stress level, job performance, and interpersonal relationships before the transition, four weeks after the transition, and, finally, six months afterward. The employees suffered according to every measure: the new space was disruptive, stressful, and cumbersome, and, instead of feeling closer, coworkers felt distant, dissatisfied, and resentful. Productivity fell.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>China&rsquo;s ban on video game consoles was temporarily lifted today, making them available to consumers living in the region after 14 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating.  And given <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-4-sales-reach-4-2-million-outselling-xbox-one-by-1-2-million-units-in-2013/1100-6416987/" target="_blank">a strong rollout by both Microsoft and Sony</a>, it looks to me that console gaming is still alive and well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android devices are famously slow to receive major software updates, and tend to get none at all. The carriers control the updates for Android phones, and the carriers really do want you to buy a new phone as soon as your two-year contract is up. Even with Google’s Nexus phones — for which Google, not the carriers, issues software updates, like Apple does — they only support an 18-month window for OS updates. Thus their own Galaxy Nexus phone, released in November 2011, did not qualify for the Android 4.4 update released a few months ago.</p>
  
  <p>Apple supports four generations of iPhone with iOS 7, Google just two generations of Nexus phone with Android 4.4 — but it’s Apple that has widely been accused of devious “planned obsolescence”.</p>

      <a href="http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/12/17/cristiano-ronaldos-letter-to-florida-attorneys-office-leads-to-dropped-charges-for-canadian-fan/">A poor, but heartfelt choice</a><br/><p>Here&rsquo;s the setup:  Real Madrid are playing against Chelsea in Florida as part of a pre-season tournament across the United States.  It&rsquo;s a rare chance for soccer fans to see the world&rsquo;s best on their home soil.</p>

<p>During the game Ronald Gjok, a Cristiano Ronaldo super fan, runs on to the field and approaches the man who is currently the best footballer on Earth.  It&rsquo;s a dangerous situation when any fan runs on to the field, but <em>this</em> fan simply gives Ronaldo a great big hug.</p>

<center>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-MqUFSXcoZo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p></p></center>

<p>As Joe O'Connor writes, it was a potentially scary moment that turned into a bit of tear-jerker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a hug that, well, kept on hugging, and the best part about it was that Ronaldo hugged the kid back, on a hot August night, a touching embrace that ultimately resulted in Gjoka getting tossed in jail for 36 hours and being charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct. Nuisance charges that, upon conviction, would potentially make life a little complicated for the Florida community college student in terms of finding a job and actually remaining in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that the fan clearly broke the law, but Ronaldo himself took the steps to make a case for the 20-year-old, which likely helped prosecutors decide to drop the charges against him.</p>

<p>Later, I would tune in to soccer games on <a href="http://www.watchespn.com" target="_blank">WatchESPN</a> Xbox as a way to help me sleep.  Somehow, the steady roar of the crowd and commentators helped me relax.</p>

<p>Soon after, I realized just how <em>big</em> international football is.  I starting learning about all the top-flight players across the BPL, Liga BBVA, Series A, and Ligue 1.  WatchESPN just wasn&rsquo;t enough anymore, so I caved in and bought cable again.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until I found <a href="http://www.beinsport.tv/" target="_blank">BEIN Sport</a>, featuring the incredible commentary of Ray Hudson.  Now, Richard Sandomir New York Times helps us get to know the reluctant broadcaster whose enthusiasm for the game is unmatched by anyone in sports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Hudson’s world, soccer is a wild, multilayered legend with brave lads, paleface assassins, emasculations and cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. Superstars sprinkle stardust. Men backpedal in high heels. Defenders disappear like the children in “The Blair Witch Project” and forwards peel away from pursuers like tissue off a toilet roll. He once said that Lionel Messi, the Barcelona star who has long been a Hudson favorite, plays so beautifully “he could make an onion cry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that one man in a small room in Florida can project the excitement and passion of people on the other side of the world; simply by sound of his voice.</p>

<p>I use Tweetbot to mute people and I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I blocked anyone.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/11/14/lets-talk-about-healthcaregov.html">Let's talk about healthcare.gov</a></h1>

      <p>I&rsquo;m surprised news agencies are spending so little time discussing the sheer difficulty of launching a massive website like Healthcare.gov.  This is a monumental undertaking; and after three years of development the shaky rollout came as no surprise to me.</p>

<p>In fairness, I&rsquo;ve been following tech and the web for an admittedly limited time compared to many other &ldquo;analysts,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve yet to see a large website enjoy roll out without problems.  In fact, most major websites are handled with great care in effort to assure it can handle the demands of millions of potential viewers.</p>

<p>Take Reuters for example.  If you go to <a href="http://www.reuters.com" target="_blank">its homepage</a> you&rsquo;ll see its current design as it&rsquo;s been for quite some time now.  But you can also try <a href="http://beta.reuters.com" target="_blank">a special link that takes you to a &ldquo;beta&rdquo; site</a>.  It features much, if not all the information found on it&rsquo;s &ldquo;old&rdquo; website, but it&rsquo;s all presented in a fresh, responsive design that aligns it&rsquo;s web component with it&rsquo;s apps on the iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p>This is standard practice on the web.  Presenting the new site in &ldquo;beta&rdquo; form gives developers a chance to iron out any problems that occur when a website goes live.  Developers grant access to a limited audience at first, before opening the site to all, then they <a href="http://sneakpeek.reuters.com" target="_blank">urge people to leave feedback if they see any problems</a>.</p>

<p>That Reuters is still working on the beta months after it went live is a testament to the difficulty of launching a major website in front of a potential onslaught of millions of viewers.</p>

<p>Consider this:  Apple has been riding high for years now thanks to the success of the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.  Those products have been so successful, it&rsquo;s collecting so many hundreds of billions of dollars in <em>cash</em> that it can hardly figure out what to do with it all.  Yet, everytime a major project goes on sale on <a href="http://www.applestore.com" target="_blank">its online store</a>, its servers crumble under the wieght of millions of people trying to buy a phone.  Just a phone.</p>

<p>Consider Twitter.  The social media juggernaut enjoyed historic growth since it went live in 2006.  Now, millions of people rely on it as <em>the</em> place to follow breaking news as it happens.  <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/11/06/how-twitter-slayed-the-fail-whale/" target="_blank">But starting around 2008</a>, it became known much for its historic artwork that appeared everytime the website went down.</p>

<p>The art was lovingly named the &ldquo;Fail Whale&rdquo; Twitter&rsquo;s remarkably simple platform of collecting thoughts often took a backseat to the whale.  Today, the &ldquo;Fail Whale&rdquo; is a distant memory, as Twitters servers have finally caught up with the damand.</p>

<p>Apply such thinking to Healthcare.gov.  Being a product of the federal government, it opened it&rsquo;s virtual doors with no such luxury shared by Reuters, or a small startup like Twitter in 2006.  The federal healthcare exchange is expected to handle the load of millions of people doing some, if not all of the following:</p>

<ul><li>Visiting the site</li>
<li>Shopping for eligible coverage</li>
<li>Entering personal information</li>

  <p>The second point is these networks are complex. In some cases it&rsquo;s simply not possible to test them short of going live and there&rsquo;s no upper limit to how much can be spent on test-simulations of questionable value. To use a physical analogy, a specific subway car or tunnel can certainly be tested. But the only practical way to learn how an entire subway network in a large city that is in turn plugged into a larger and more diverse transportation grid made of pedestrians on sidewalks, roads and highways, cabs, buses, airports, ferries, ports, and several million personal vehicles, all powered by giant fossil fuel distribution networks and regional electric power grids will behave at rush hour is to open it up for business and see what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editors go on to point out three examples of successful online services, all having shaky roll outs.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever seen a major website go live without a &ldquo;Beta&rdquo; tag, or a staggered rollout.  Healthcare.gov had no such luxury. It went live, people came flooding in, and the walls came crashing down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judging the “creation” capabilities of the iPad by its screen size misses the point. The iPad mini is a great device for content creation – in fact, I’d argue that because of its smaller screen, lighter body, and higher portability, the iPad mini can be better than the full-size iPad Air for work and productivity tasks. And, because of the larger screen, I could argue that the iPad Air is more suited for activities that benefit from a larger viewing area, such as playing games, watching movies, or browsing photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more I look at it, the more advantages I see in the iPad mini with Retina display.  It’s sheer “holdability” fascinates me.</p>

<p>For example, I do a lot of my writing slouched on the couch, iPad 3 in both hands, using the split keyboard. It all works fine, but wouldn’t the Mini work better?</p>

<p>The iPad Air would make that same situation much better. But why pay the extra $100 for “the big one?”</p>

<p>Instead of dropping $599 for a 32GB Wi-Fi model, I could instead pay $30 more for a Retina Mini with Wi-Fi, add LTE.  I’m ultimately buying a <em>more</em> capable device for less.  Fascinating.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/10/23/the-new-ipads.html">The New iPads </a></h1>

      <p>The naming of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/index1.html" target="_blank">iPad Air</a> is telling.  Apple knows the iPad is much more than an accessory device. It is a legitimate personal computer with lots of horsepower in tap; all while still being simple enough for just about everyone in the world figure out.</p>

<p>Thus, it only makes sense to continue moving iPad away from the &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; naming convention and over to the &ldquo;serious computer&rdquo; side of the spectrum. I only hope the iPhone soon follows.</p>

<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank">Mavericks</a> a half hour before this writing, but I haven&rsquo;t delved much into it, mostly because I simply spend so much more time on my iOS devices.  The iPad is:</p>

<ul><li>where I read everything</li>
<li>where I write <em>almost</em> everything, and</li>
<li>where I play and record guitar</li>
</ul><p>My 2012 base iMac is much more powerful but it&rsquo;s increasingly becoming the device that I tell myself to use, while the iPad is not just my first choice, it&rsquo;s my first instinct.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently using an iPad 3 and it&rsquo;s just as excellent as the day I used it. I&rsquo;m torn between the iPad Air and the top end <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/index1.html" target="_blank">iPad Mini</a>. I think I would go with the Air simply because it&rsquo;s only a quarter of a pound heavier, so there&rsquo;s less incentive to switch to the smaller screen.</p>

<p>Whenever I can afford a new iPad, there may be one thing holding me back: Touch ID.</p>

<p>I tend to think of the iPhone as a 2 year proposition. As soon as the contract is up, I&rsquo;m due for the next iPhone which will surely have Touch ID.</p>

<p>I think of the iPad as a much longer deal, and as soon as I get an iPhone with Touch ID, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll want it on every single Apple device I own. Maybe it would be wise for me to wait one more year before upgrading from my trusty 3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scrapping of Twitter #Music, when it occurs, marks a clear misstep in the company’s online music strategy, which has lacked direction over the past year. The app was atypically developed in isolation inside the company. It was a sort of a skunkworks project led by former Twitter business development leader Kevin Thau, and built by the team behind “We Are Hunted,” a company Twitter acquired to work on music products. Twitter #Music, according to people familiar with its development, was never fully integrated with the overall product team as it was being built.</p>

<p>With Facebook, I like having a standalone messaging app because I no longer have to look at Facebook just to communicate with a few friends.</p>

<p>But I like looking at Twitter, I just hate how it buried DM&rsquo;s so deeply inside its native app.  Twitter is so basic, it can stand to put DM&rsquo;s further up front in the app without needing an external solution.</p>

  <p>For the first time, here was a van with copious amounts of room that drove like a car and not a truck. Here was a large space-efficient vehicle built first with passengers in mind and cargo second. Its mission was to haul your family around town, not deliver packages or carry service equipment (though later cargo versions were introduced). Based on Chrysler’s near-ubiquitous front-wheel drive K-car platform, which underpinned everything from the Aries sedan to the Daytona sports car, the Caravan and Voyager caught the rest of Detroit by surprise. Years later, attempting to play catch up, neither GM nor Ford was ever able to steal Chrysler’s thunder.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think there’s an additional explanation to account for the overall trend: Google has steadily been “linking” its mobile apps for iOS together. Case in point: In May, Google updated Gmail for iOS so that links in mail could be automatically opened inside Chrome, not Safari. Google quickly followed up with a new programming method for third-party iOS developers to do the same, saying “With Chrome’s OpenInChromeController class with x-callback, users can open a web page in Chrome and then return to your app with just one tap.”</p>

<p>Lots of apps have added &ldquo;open in Chrome&rdquo; support over the past year or so. People seem to like it.  But as much as I like it, haven&rsquo;t found any advantage to using Chrome on iOS.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Had a conventional gasoline car encountered the same object on the highway, the result could have been far worse. A typical gasoline car only has a thin metal sheet protecting the underbody, leaving it vulnerable to destruction of the fuel supply lines or fuel tank, which causes a pool of gasoline to form and often burn the entire car to the ground. In contrast, the combustion energy of our battery pack is only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank and is divided into 16 modules with firewalls in between. As a consequence, the effective combustion potential is only about 1% that of the fuel in a comparable gasoline sedan.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great that the Google/Motorola experiment is bringing jobs to Texas, but the devices have to <em>sell</em> to make it sustainable.  That remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I would love it if Apple did this with more than just the Mac Pro, but at the rate Apple sells iPhones and iPads, it&rsquo;s perhaps not entirely realistic.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/09/24/all-about-the-updates.html">All about the updates</a></h1>

      <p>This is a great move.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/23/moto-x-update-camera/?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget&amp;ncid=rss_semi" target="_blank">As reported by Engadget,</a> Anandtech calls it &ldquo;nothing short of the biggest [improvement] I&rsquo;ve ever seen come across in an OTA update.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem inherent with all Android updates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The refresh, which is so far getting pushed out to T-Mobile phones &ndash; we expect it to roll out to other carriers as soon as each one is done testing the new firmware, though nothing is currently confirmed&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is perhaps the biggest stumbling block when it comes to recommending an Android phone.  I had the same problem when I used Blackberry, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/09/blackberry-sold/" target="_blank">look how all that turned out</a>.</p>

<p>With Apple, OS updates may be slightly staggered, but they are not dictated by a carrier.  Where Blackberry updates would take months to land on customers phones, iOS updates are a available within roughly a day or so of its release.</p>

<p>And it works.  Apple announced today that <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html" target="_blank">200 million devices have already been updated to iOS 7</a>.  With that news, developers know there&rsquo;s already a massive market that&rsquo;s waiting for them to use the absolute latest features brought by iOS.</p>

<p>So whether it&rsquo;s enjoying all the new features baked in to iOS, or finding that great app made by a lone developer, all this makes for an incredibly exciting environment to spend your time.</p>

<p>I spend a ridiculous amount of time on my iPhone and iPad reading, communicating, and writing for this site.  And I know I can do so with all the latest and most innovative software, as securely as possible. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true with Android, <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/9/23/platform-updates-and-the-rate-of-innovation" target="_blank">at least not yet. </a> These facts made it easy to choose and iPhone over Blackberry, and it&rsquo;s those that continue keeping me from choosing Android.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/09/23/cristiano-ronaldos-exponential-growth.html">Cristiano Ronaldo's exponential growth</a></h1>

      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo stands aside Lionel Messi as the two greatest footballers on earth.  However, they come from two different worlds, and Ronaldo&rsquo;s road to immortality wasn&rsquo;t quite as clear as Messi&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whoscored.com/Blog/afrjipqbxuymjkqkdeg07q/Show/Player-Focus-Cristiano-Ronaldos-Exponential-Growth" target="_blank">Miguel Delaney plotted Ronaldo&rsquo;s statistical ascendency into what is arguable his prime</a>, and the results were surprising, given the potential of his contemporaries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point to all of this is not just that Ronaldo has obviously improved, honed his game or altered his position. It is that he has gone from a scoring record that was arguably less than mediocre for a talented young winger, to one that is of historic quality for anyone in the sport.</p>
  
  <p>In that context, it is genuinely remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Sunday, Ronaldo scored his 208th goal in 205 appearances.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sh2mqMHyWe0" target="_blank">Even the goal itself was a work of art</a>.</p>

<p>The point is, Spanish football is in a bit of a golden age.  I&rsquo;m very late to the party, but I urge everyone to join in while it lasts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the good old days, the journalism business was subsidized by all of the other things a newspaper contained apart from the news. This included classified ads, obviously, but also horoscopes, gardening columns, the comic page and other add-ons that had little or nothing to do with news or journalism. Gradually the internet has taken most of these pillars away, and left newspapers with just the hard news — in other words, the only thing no one wants to pay for.</p>

  <p>Marissa sent a text to the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking in the U.S., and in just two hours the nonprofit and law enforcement officers coordinated a way to remove her from the dangerous situation.</p>

<p>According to Larson, Polaris Project is just one of many non-profits joining up with tech companies to do some truly incredible work.  Great read.</p>

      <a href="http://crackberry.com/i-m-happy-hear-about-larger-round-job-cuts-blackberry"> Blackberry to cut 4,500 jobs</a><br/><p>I was ready to trash this article <a href="http://crackberry.com/i-m-happy-hear-about-larger-round-job-cuts-blackberry" target="_blank">after reading the title</a>, but as Chris Umiastowski points out, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/20/bad-news-from-blackberry-4-500-jobs-to-be-cut-expected-q2-net/" target="_blank">Blackberry&rsquo;s round massive layoffs</a> is a tragic but necessary move brought by years of mismanagement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think there is any way to avoid sounding like I’m sugar coating bad news. That’s fine. That is what happens when you discuss the necessity of job cuts as a company reacts to the market rather than being proactive, as I wish BlackBerry had been. But these cuts are necessary. BlackBerry needs to get back to having a manageable base of employees who are focused on the few critical projects and programs.</p>
  
  <p>A leaner BlackBerry with 7600 employees seems like it should be able to make decisions faster and get the important things done. Key word being “should”. In the end it all comes down to execution, which is where people have a perfectly valid reason for criticizing the company over the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time will tell on the execution side of things.  I&rsquo;m just glad I moved away from Blackberry when I did.</p>

      <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/20/apple-munster-iphone-numbers/">By the numbers: Apple's U.S. launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C</a><br/><p>Philip Elmer-Dewitt quotes data from Piper Jaffray&rsquo;s Gene Munster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>90% of iPhone 5S/5C buyers were upgrading from another version of the iPhone compared to 83% for the iPhone 5 launch and 73% for the iPhone 4S. We note that given the relative maturity of the smartphone market in the US, it is not surprising to see that a majority of iPhone 5S/5C buyers were current iPhone users. We believe that the high level of iPhone users upgrading to the new 5S or 5C demonstrates continued high loyalty levels among iPhone users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, depending on how you look at it, Apple is either retaining a huge share of its customers by making great products with useful new features, or they&rsquo;re brainwashing them by reskinning year old tech or year old looks, then overcharging people for it.</p>

<p>I argue the former.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony’s PlayStation 4 console doesn’t offer traditional backwards compatibility with the PS3 game library. But when the company announced its acquisition of Gaikai last year, gamers immediately began hoping the technology would eventually let them play Uncharted, Heavy Rain, Ratchet and Clank, and other PlayStation hits on the next-gen hardware. To their delight, Sony has now made those plans official.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news. I’m holding out on titles like GTA V as I get ready for the PS4 launch. It’s good to know there’s at least a chance that I’ll be able to play it on a next-gen console.</p>

  <p>According to Tim Cook, Apple will sell its 700th million iOS device next month. As of last January, roughly half of the iOS devices sold were still in use. If that ratio holds, it puts the number of downloads at roughly 100 million, or 6.3 million per hour. At 1.2 gigabytes per iPhone download (1.3GB for iPad) that&rsquo;s nearly 2.2 terabytes per second.</p>
  
  <p>Could that explain why by Wednesday afternoon Internet traffic was running at 112%, with hotspots in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. where iPhone adoption is highest?</p>

  <p>Penning lengthy treatises about the mechanics of iOS 7 design, whilst exclusively using iOS 6-designed third party apps for testing, is reductive and short-sighted.  iOS 7, just like its predecessors, is not an experience dictated by or constituted of the mechanics of the Weather or Mail apps.

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-reviews-are-in.html">Grand Theft Auto V reviews are in</a></h1>

      <p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-5-review/" target="_blank">Joystiq’s Xa de Matos</a> finds flaws in the games story, which features 3 protagonists for the first time in the series:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where Grand Theft Auto 5 loses its focus, ironically, is where the player has the least freedom: the story. As the three characters grow closer, the narrative goes from an interesting story of past mistakes, redemption and revenge to the story of three men screaming at each other in a seemingly endless cycle. This centers mostly on Michael and Trevor’s shared history. After a lengthy time apart, emotions between the former colleagues come to a head, and GTA5 pounds at this conflict for far too long. At every turn, the pair are at each other’s throats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/16/4736176/grand-theft-auto-v-review" target="_blank">Andrew Webster at The Verge</a> argues the story is the best in the series, and actually makes all the other standard GTA craziness feel out of place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the more sophisticated narrative also means that the disconnect between the story and what you’re doing on a moment-to-moment basis is greater than ever. Outside of the main story missions, there’s an almost ludicrous breadth of things for you to do. From silly diversions like going hunting or racing jet skis, to fully fleshed out characters and storylines that are completely optional, you’re never left wanting for things to do. And outside of that, in traditional GTA fashion, you can also just make your own fun, stealing cars, creating panic in the streets, and just generally being a murderous nuisance for the fun of it. These moments have a more serious feel than in earlier games, but they can still be pretty fun. When you’re meant to be fighting to get your family back, or searching for a kidnapped friend, it just feels weird to be able to steal a dirt bike and go joyriding through the mountains. This has always been the case in GTA, and the freedom is a large part of the franchise’s appeal, but it often feels off this time; GTA V’s more engaging story makes this discrepancy larger than in the past.</p>

      <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OmMalik/~3/VjyEjeUHcaQ/">Apple’s M7 chip is the Trojan Horse for its wearable computing plans</a><br/><p>Chris Brandrick also envisions the M7 showing up in other devices, namely the one on your wrist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually this new chip will inevitably make its way into a range of other products across the iOS product line, with it growing the number of supported apps. In due course, there will likely be a number of apps that a companion device — namely a wrist-worn gadget of some form — could support.</p>
  
  <p>It may not be a watch, but imagine a FuelBand or FitBit-esque (see disclosure), Apple-designed wrist companion device — M7 chip included — tracking your motion without the need to remember “Is my phone in my pocket?” Heading over to the restroom or leaving the office to make a coffee may seem like small granular activities, but to die-hard app trackers, say for those using a pedometer app, it all adds up. With some form of wrist device, it doesn’t matter if your phone skips the journey and stays at your desk.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/13/m-is-for-mystery/" target="_blank">Horace Dediu argues</a> the new M7 coprocessor isn’t just built for the iPhone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hence the question of what is the M7′s job to be done. As part of an iPhone, it does not seem to have one. Saving a bit of battery life is not a job, and certainly not one that needs to have billing in a media special event. The answer must be that the M7 was developed for some other, as yet unstated reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://cannyvision.com/2013/09/12/the-most-forward-thinking-apple-yet.html" target="_blank">Sisir Koppaka</a> digs deeper into such possibilities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t believe Apple added 64-bit support to iOS 7 and all their apps just to prepare for an eventual transition to 4GB+ memory capacities in future iPhones. I think this was to do with something more impending. Do we know any product category that Apple would be interested in, that would require the use of both iOS and an A-series chip that is 64-bit capable in order to address 4GB+ memory?</p>
  
  <p>Apple TV (the one that is yet to come, not the one that exists).</p>
  
  <p>Just a few days prior to WWDC this summer, the Xbox One was annnounced with 8GB memory. The 360 had 512 MB of memory. Earlier in January this year, the PS4 was announced with 8GB of memory. The PS3 had 256MB of system memory.</p>
  
  <p>If Apple were to release a competing living room solution now, as Steve Jobs claimed they had figured out, it would definitely have to have around 8GB of memory (if they were interested in addressing big screen console gaming seriously). It would also likely be iOS, and not OS X, that would be needed. I think that is why Apple just announced full-scale hardware and software 64-bit support, not because phones will eventually have 4GB of memory sometime in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether it’s a TV connected device, a wearable device, or something unfathomable, Apple is clearly positioning itself for some interesting future endeavors.</p>

  <p>The deal is designed to convince iPad owners to switch to Surface tablets. Microsoft was forced to cut its Surface RT price by 30 percent worldwide after slow sales of the devices and a $900 million write-down. The company has also cut its Surface Pro tablet by $100 recently. Microsoft is holding a special Surface event in New York City on September 23rd where it’s expected to launch the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/09/06/hello-nintendo.html">Hello, Nintendo</a></h1>

      <p>Since <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/new/" target="_blank">Nintendo launched the 2DS</a>, there has been lots of talk over the future of the company and how it should move forward in a world full of smartphones and tablets, all pining for the attention and adoration of the world’s young people.  As it stands, it <em>appears</em> that post-PC devices are winning that fight. But it doesn’t mean Nintendo is out of the game</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/more_on_nintendo" target="_blank">John Gruber argues that Nintendo should join them, since they can’t beat them</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future of portable gaming is clearly on post-PC computing platforms. (The future of living room gaming may well rest on these platforms, too.) A dedicated camera takes better photographs. A Mac or Windows laptop is far more powerful for numerous computing tasks. A simple dumb phone will last for a month on a single charge. An iPod makes for a lighter weight, more durable music player. Yet all these things are losing sales to iOS and Android post-PC devices. DS-style  handheld gaming platforms are no different, and perhaps in a worse situation than the others. Priced for the low-end (like the upcoming 2DS) and they pale in terms of graphics. Compete on graphics and they pale in terms of price compared to carrier-subsidized phones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other arguments suggest Nintendo should stay the course, citing its ability to consistently survive threats from powerful opponents all by itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/09/02/nintendo-in-crisis" target="_blank">John Siracusa has made the best argument for this option</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The game software business is tough. It’s hit-driven, like Hollywood. Most games lose money or break even. A few big winners fund all the others—if you’re lucky. A game development studio going out of business shortly after releasing a critically acclaimed game is not unheard of. (Hell, the best game released last *year bankrupted its developer.)</p>
  
  <p>Consolidation is rampant in game development. Small players are routinely snatched up by behemoths that have a better capacity to absorb the inevitable losses that come with games that are not monster sales successes.</p>
  
  <p>This is not a world that Nintendo should aspire to enter. Better to stick with hardware platforms that it controls, profiting from both the hardware sales and the fees collected from third-party games sold on its platforms. That’s the kind of steady (and potentially enormous) income that will keep Nintendo afloat as it works on the next big thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both are excellent arguments, but all the talk has left me thinking one thing: <em>I kind of really want to buy a Nintendo 2DS, maybe</em>.  I never cared for the 3D, I think it looks great, it features a bazillion games, several that I wouldn’t mind playing, and it’s almost priced right ($99 would have sealed the deal).</p>

<p>Any talk, be it positive or negative about Nintendo and its situation, is good for Nintendo.  Perhaps that in some way confirms both sides of the argument.</p>

<p>It’s great that the great tech minds are debating Nintendo, because before the debate began, I hadn’t thought about buying its handheld for at least 2 years.  Now, it’s at the very least on my radar.</p>

<p>The problem is, only the great tech pundits are postulating the decisions of Nintendo, not the mainstream.</p>

<p>If Nintendo can cross that divide, I think they’ll weather the storm and strike it big again, like Siracusa says. If not, as Gruber says, perhaps it’s best to “join em”.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/06/27/ode-to-google-reader.html">Ode to Google Reader</a></h1>

      <p>Last night while reading about the upcoming demise of Google Reader, it hit me: <em>Google Reader changed my life</em>.</p>

<p>While looking for laptop to take to college circa 2006, I stumbled onto reviews of the brand new Intel-based MacBook; the ones with the crappy white plastic that turned yellow as soon as you touched it.</p>

<p>I bought that MacBook, my second Apple product behind a 30GB iPod. But perhaps more importantly, I started reading tech blogs.  First it was <a href="http://www.engadget.com" target="_blank">Engadget</a>, which ultimately led me to <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="http://www.bgr.com" target="_blank">Boy Genius Report</a>, and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a>.</p>

<p>Soon, I would be in the market for a smartphone to replace my tiny Ericsson piece, which led me to sites like found under the umbrella of <a href="http://www.mobilenations.com" target="_blank">Mobile Nations</a>.</p>

<p>So, here I am with all these websites and no easy way to read them other than to scroll through my Firefox bookmarks.</p>

<p>I think I ultimately heard about Google Reader on the Engadget podcast, though I can&rsquo;t be sure.  But whoever revealed its existence deserves a nice firm handshake, because finally I was able to put all of my favorite websites in one place.  For a while, I used it to skim through to find virtually every phone, pc, laptop, or tablet review <em>all in one place</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>In a couple of days Google Reader simply will not exist, but RSS Readers will and they&rsquo;ll be even better than Google&rsquo;s product ever was.</p>

<p>But give credit where credit is due. Google Reader brought the RSS Reader to the masses, so that stupid kids like me, lacking of any knowledge of code or gadgetry, could finally bring it all together and discover what the beautiful tech-blogger world is all about.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cars were made out of exotic materials, like they are today, except instead of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and kevlar, they were built out of magnesium. Magnesium is light, which is great for racing, but it also burns, and it burns hot. Spectators, too, received little protection, with nothing like a catch fence to protect them. This was tragically shown in 1955.</p>
  
  <p>The 1955 Le Mans Disaster remains the worst tragedy ever to befall motorsport. 87 spectators were killed, along with driver Pierre Levegh, and 120 more were injured when Levegh&rsquo;s Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR crashed into the grandstand. Pieces of the car went flying into the crowd, and the car&rsquo;s magnesium bodywork quickly caught fire.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has held the line on some of the encroaching creepiness, but hasn’t been praised for it. Just the opposite. Apple cut its ties with Google for Maps data because Google wanted your user info and Apple wouldn’t give it to them. The quality of iOS Maps went down, and everyone dumped on Apple for providing an inferior product.</p>
  
  <p>Why was Apple’s mapping data inferior? Part of it, certainly, was because they got a late start. But the main reason Google’s maps are better is that Google spent a lot of time and money on its maps, and it did that because it knew that spending would pay off in the collection and selling of your information. In effect, the creepiness of Google is what makes Google Maps so good.</p>

<p>If only we were <em>all</em> in jail, then I suppose, based on this logic, there would be no violence.</p>

<p>In seriousness, the commenter&rsquo;s had 237 &ldquo;up votes&rdquo; though their criteria for a life prison sentence is murky at best.</p>

<p>Better immediate questions:  Was the officer alone? If so, why then did the officer approach a suspect who was holding a loaded gun at a victims head, all by himself?  Did he have any training in this type of situation?  Do <em>all</em> officers get training for this type of situation?  What is an officer <em>supposed</em> to do in a situation like this?  How did this home invasion end up with a gun to a woman&rsquo;s head, with three other victims outside the home?</p>

  <p>While the look of the updated system may be surprising to some, iOS 7 is reportedly not more difficult to use than earlier versions of software platform. There is apparently no new learning curve in the same way there was no learning curve when the iPods went color. While iOS 7 does look different, its core apps and system fundamentals  (like the Lock and Home screens) mostly operate in a similar fashion to how they do today.</p>

<p>If this is true, I&rsquo;ll take it. iOS&rsquo;s functionality lacks features that look good on a spreadsheet, but when such simplicity is met by a massive base of eager developers, amazing things can happen.</p>

<p>A: I would have to assume that the first guy that sang “kumbaya” was doing it because he was furious. To generalize, I’d say that the competitiveness people feel can be applied to any business. No matter what your feelings are, if they’re inappropriate or come across as bitter, you learn to keep them to yourself. There’s diplomacy to it; it’s being a grown-up. But it’s my assumption that we’re all kind of competitive. The trick is to realize that everything in the world is not a threat to you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s entirely plausible to me that Apple would simply follow the model set by the iPhone, where the latest model is the flagship, and the previous model or two hang around at lower price points.</p>

  <p>The one important exception to this dismal record is electronic brainstorming, where large groups outperform individuals; and the larger the group the better. The protection of the screen mitigates many problems of group work. This is why the Internet has yielded such wondrous collective creations. Marcel Proust called reading a “miracle of communication in the midst of solitude,” and that’s what the Internet is, too. It’s a place where we can be alone together — and this is precisely what gives it power.</p>

She is an anomaly; a product of the freak-onomy of her time. Barack Obama, interestingly, said in his statement that she had “broken the glass ceiling for other women”. Only in the sense that all the women beneath her were blinded by falling shards. She is an icon of individualism, not of feminism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After World War II, the majority of the Slavic people of the Balkans, who had long been under the rule of various empires and exchanged like pawns in a giant game of chess, came together to form one independent state: Yugoslavia. The state was composed of six republics and two autonomous regions and, for the most part, ethnic and religious differences were smoothed out and hidden under the rug of nationalism. Yugoslavia survived, in one form or another, for nearly sixty years. But after the death of long-time ruler Josip Broz Tito, the union began to disintegrate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CRX was a pure sports car. What it might have lacked in straight-line power, it more than made up for in the curves. The little car handled like it was on rails and, because John and I sometimes swapped keys, I soon found that I could carry a great deal of speed through the corners. It was a fun, slick little car and I enjoyed every chance I got to slide behind its wheel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a 91 CRX Si for a couple of years or so.  It was both incredible and infuriating.  It&rsquo;s the car I credit for teaching me how to drive.  From the moment I sat in it&rsquo;s tiny little frame, I never looked at cars the same way again.</p>

<p>But after a couple of years, it became extremely difficult to live with.  At over 220,000 miles, the engine was in the twilight of its life.  The ride was extremely unforgiving, and the interior squeaked and rattled at intolerable levels.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to let it go, and just months later it was &ldquo;t-boned&rdquo; and totaled.  I hope the driver made it out of the crash safely, and as much as I loved the car, I&rsquo;m really glad I wasn&rsquo;t in that crash.</p>

      <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130226/when-an-ipad-isnt-enough/">Walt Mossberg's terrible advice </a><br/><p>A reader tells Walt Mossberg what he “needs”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave my wife an iPad for Christmas and she is delighted with it. Unfortunately, I discovered that it would be useless for my purposes. I would need a tablet that acts like a desktop or laptop but is smaller and lighter. Specifically, I would need a tablet that would allow me to have three browsers open and visible on the screen simultaneously. Are there any tablets that would allow me to do this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea why anyone would need three browsers open at a time, but whatever.</p>

<p>Mossberg’s response is even more bizarre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d suggest you look at one of the new Windows 8 tablets that are powered by a laptop-class Intel processor and can run full, standard Windows. Perhaps the best known of these may be Microsoft’s Surface Pro, but there are others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a terrible suggestion. First, I would say if the only reason you’re holding out on a iPad is the need for a bunch of browser windows, it’s time to seriously rethink your workflow.  Walt closes with this warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A warning, though: These tablets are typically heavier, pricier and have less battery life than an iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Way less.</em> So much less, they shouldn’t even be recommended. If one needs more functionality than an iPad, then laptops are the only legitimate option. There are plenty of light, powerful laptops for either operating system that would serve his needs much better than a hopelessly compromised Windows 8 tablet.</p>

<blockquote>

      <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/02/apples-2013-to-do-list">Siracusa predicts the future</a><br/><p>John Siracusa makes the case for more iPhones:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selling models from previous years at a discount is no longer good enough. Apple can make more attractive phones at similar prices if they’re purpose-built using modern parts and processes. Margins may go down, but sales will go up. Apple has done this before, with the Mac, the iPod, and now the iPad. It’s the iPhone’s turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best explanation so far in favor of a broader line of iPhones.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I proudly told coworkers of my prediction: Apple will stay the course and release a brand new iPhone, a cheaper iPhone 5, then free iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Siracusa, I can easily see it going the other way.</p>

      <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3911972/vine-hands-on-twitter-takes-on-video-sharing">Vine is actually pretty cool. </a><br/><p>It&rsquo;s made by Twitter, and as Russell Brandom writes, it&rsquo;s pretty simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shooting is remarkably simple. You start from a standard camera view, and hold down your finger to shoot. By tapping and releasing, you can easily shoot a quick montage without having to edit. A gradually filling bar above the viewfinder shows you how much time you have left. (There were rumors of a slow-motion mode for the iPhone 5, but we weren’t able to duplicate it. As far as we’re concerned, they’re still rumors.) One quirk: Vine doesn&rsquo;t auto-rotate, so you have to shoot videos with your phone in portrait rather than landscape, or they come out sideways.</p>

<p>Videos play like a GIF with audio. Very clever, though the infinite looping can be a bit annoying.</p>

<p>Honda quietly introduced a new concept car called the Gear.  And though it&rsquo;s billed as a micro-sized city car, I hope Honda sees this as the basic formula for their next generation Civic and Fit.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Honda after owning a 1991 CRX Si.  The car was amazing simple, with a clean, yet striking design. Current Honda&rsquo;s are missing that.  The Fit is a fantastic car, but still too busy. The Civic looks nice, there&rsquo;s just <em>a lot</em> going on with the exterior design, and the interior is far to busy for my tastes.</p>

<p>The Gear mirrors Volkwagen&rsquo;s recent success with the gorgeous GTI.  Clean and simple designs that hearken back to a long history of excellent vehicles.  Current Honda&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t do that, while the Gear&rsquo;s design is direct descendent of <a href="http://www.cardomain.com/ride/3897295/1983-honda-civic/" target="_blank">a 1983 Civic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The baseball establishment pronounced Alderson and La Russa as spotless. They are role models. Their integrity is unquestioned. Canseco reports that six to eight A’s were juicing by the time he was traded to Texas. But the stain did not wear off onto the men who assembled and managed them. La Russa later conceded some of his A’s were juicing, but he cut Canseco’s number in half and exempted McGwire. La Russa’s reputation remains untarnished. McGwire and Bonds are considered cheaters and their records are questioned. But nobody suggests that La Russa should not be credited as manager of the 1989 world champs.</p>

  <p>“At first, non-smartphones were popular in the Chinese market, now cheap smartphones are more popular and non-smartphones are out,” Schiller added later. “Despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this will never be the future of Apple’s products. In fact, although Apple’s market share of smartphones is just about 20%, we own the 75% of the profit.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Panzarino continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple will need to make adjustments to its product development process and its marketing strategy in order to make serious inroads in the developing smartphone markets, but how it will do so is an interesting question. The continuous effort to leverage its economies of scale to produce parts that are at the top of the quality chain, but to do so at increasingly lower prices, is where I would look if I was a betting man.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/10/certain-segments" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> comes to a similar conclusion.  It&rsquo;s never been a matter of whether or not they want to make a cheap iPhone, iPad, or any computing device for that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A decade ago, I joined one of the early social networking sites, Friendster, which struggled to find a business model and eventually collapsed as users migrated to MySpace. In the intervening years, Friendster’s brand, intellectual property (including some seminal social networking patents), and most important, user data from millions of people, were broken up or changed hands.</p>
  
  <p>Now, eons later (in Internet time), Friendster lives on as an online gaming company aimed at Southeast Asian youth. I might have eventually discovered this fact by keeping up on technology news, but it turns out there was no need: one day last year, my inbox started to fill up with Friendster marketing messages for the first time in years, and I realized that my long-forgotten decade-old profile data had been sold, without my knowledge or permission, to a company I’d never heard of in Asia. And I could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>AppData&rsquo;s measurement only shows that there was a decline in users who have Instagram connected to Facebook — while there&rsquo;s no doubt that represents a sizable and likely representative portion of Instagram users, it isn&rsquo;t the entire Instagram userbase. The decline could come from users unlinking their Facebook accounts; those users could still be using Instagram, but AppData wouldn&rsquo;t have any visibility into that. There&rsquo;s also a question of timing — by December 25th, Instagram had already reversed course on its decision, making the decline oddly timed if it is indeed related to the initial burst of outrage.</p>

<p>AppData&rsquo;s app data is inconclusive.</p>

</a><br/><p>Max Rudberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are novelty apps for people lusting for the very latest in app design. Besides using a more flat UI style, which is a topic for a different discussion, all apps contain non-standard interactions. This means users don’t know how to use them beforehand, and all start with a multi-step UI walkthrough before you get to use the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rudberg’s referring to apps like Clear, and after a <a href="https://twitter.com/phillryu/status/284428304377864193" target="_blank">twitter discussion with Clear’s developer</a>, he clarified parts of his statements.</p>

<p>But I think he’s right. I’ve owned Clear for iOS and Mac for a long time now, and every time I try to use it, I have to first <em>remember</em> how to use it.  I’ve come to an appreciation of the design and the hard work that’s gone into it, but I’ve never put the app to any good use.</p>

<p>I have a hard time watching movies or TV shows in which the director uses fancy camera angles and editing techniques that ultimately get in the way of the story.</p>

<p>Similarly, I have a hard time using an app when the developer makes UI decisions that ultimately get in the way of using the app.</p>

  <p>Although I appreciate that there is, indeed, further to go in the matter, Honan&rsquo;s update rings false to me. Simply put, Honan was swept up in the hype of a situation he didn&rsquo;t fully comprehend. Of course, he wasn&rsquo;t alone, but I think it serves as a glimmering endorsement of shutting up, getting out of the way, and reserving judgment until you have all the facts in hand.</p>

  <p>But let&rsquo;s step back for a minute and think about what this actually means. First, like every other company on the web that stores user data, Instagram has always had an expansive license to use and copy your photos. It has to — that&rsquo;s how it runs its networks of servers around the world. And Instagram&rsquo;s existing terms specifically give the company the right to &ldquo;place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content.&rdquo; Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched.</p>

  <p>And let’s pause to emphasize the importance of this step as part of the initial console setup, rather than background functionality to be sussed out later on — this fundamentally transforms how the vast majority of soon-to-be Wii U owners will interact with their Wii U. The console instantly becomes the de facto media unit, interacting with your cable box, DVR, and various digital streaming offerings, as well as directly controlling your television.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great selling point. Provided the controller works well, the Wii U could have a huge impact on a living room set up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hyundai aggressively advertised the fact that the brand offers four models that boast 40 mpg, but that claim is no longer true. The 2013 Hyundai Accent, Veloster and Elantra will now see their EPA estimates fall to either 37 or 38 miles per gallon on the highway. The report quotes Hyundai CEO John Krafcik as saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely sorry about these errors&rdquo; and blamed &ldquo;procedural errors&rdquo; in the company&rsquo;s fuel economy testing as the reason behind the discrepancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hyundai and Kia both say this is due to &ldquo;honest mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, 37 or 38mpg is still very good.  If those estimates themselves are accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hyundai is hanging its hat on the fact that competitors must resort to special high-fuel economy models or diesel power to net the big 4-0 on the highway, and they&rsquo;ve been positively champing at the bit to remind you that whether you purchase a manual or automatic, every Elantra boasts 29 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway. That&rsquo;s impressive, but when the rubber met the road, we were only able to average about 31 mpg during our week of mixed driving with the car. That&rsquo;s still rock-solid, but a bit below the EPA&rsquo;s combined estimate of 33 mpg.</p>

<p>I wish nothing but the absolute best for Scott Forstall.  What he has accomplished with iOS is simply unprecedented.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this seems like the right decision.  The <em>obvious</em> decision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of Twitter’s recent enforcement of token limits, we only have a limited number of tokens available for Tweetbot for Mac. These tokens dictate how many users Tweetbot for Mac can have. The app’s limit is separate from, but much smaller than, the limit for Tweetbot for iOS. Once we use up the tokens granted to us by Twitter, we will no longer be able to sell the app to new users. Tapbots will continue to support Tweetbot for Mac for existing customers at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They couldn&rsquo;t give it away, and they certainly couldn&rsquo;t have made it cheap.  The high price means people that have no business owning the app will have no reason purchase it.</p>

<p>Now, Tapbots can rest assured that whenever that token cap is reached, they&rsquo;ll only have a large, devoted, enthusiastic user base to support.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the right decision for all of us.</p>

      <p>I took the Das and my Apple USB Keyboard to work today.</p>

<p>Today’s impression:  I love the gastly Das.</p>

<p>A little bit of time really does make a difference.  While at first I kept “bottoming out” while typing with the Das, things seems to click yesterday.  I began trusting the keyboard to register at the proper point, proving how much less energy is needed to press the key.  It’s a <em>huge</em> difference.</p>

<p>I typed quite a lot from 1:30pm to 10:00pm today.  Even at the end of the day, I still felt good about typing on the Das.  I have completely come around to that ugly thing.</p>

<p>It’s also not as loud as I had anticipated.  It’s probably louder than other keyboards around me, but it’s a noisy environment, so I don’t think it will be a problem.</p>

<p>I left the Das at work, and now I miss it.  I may have to hunt down a ten-keyless clicky keyboard now.</p>

      <p>Most of the day was spent on the Apple Bluetooth keyboard.  I&rsquo;m weary of getting the Das dirty, as I still have a feeling that it&rsquo;s going to be sent back to Amazon.  It&rsquo;s conterintuitive.  I didn&rsquo;t get back on the Das until 5:30pm.</p>

<p>I called my girlfriend earlier and told her about the new keyboard.  When I switched from using my iPhone speaker to the included headset speaker, she immediately heard the sheer loudness of the Das and forced me to switch to the Apple keyboard.</p>

<p>When I switched, I noticed that the Apple keyboard felt weird.  I was making a lot of mistakes while typing, and I started to feel the extra pressure I needed to press down the key.  Interesting.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m back with the Das, and I&rsquo;m actively trying now to bottom out.  It&rsquo;s definitely less noisy that way, along with being easier on my fingers.</p>

<p>I really miss the Apple function keys, like the volume and brightness keys.  I know there&rsquo;s some way to get them on a second hand keyboard, I just haven&rsquo;t found it.</p>

<p>Something about the Apple keyboard: I have one of the USB extended keyboards sitting closeby.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve been using them so long and they&rsquo;re so easy to use, why not just take one of them to work?  It looks easy to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; to Windows, too.  It&rsquo;ll be easy to type on, quiet and comfortable.  Plus, I&rsquo;ll be using the same keyboard at all times.  Problem solved.(?)</p>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;ll be taking <strong>two</strong> keyboards to work tomorrow.</p>

      <p>This is a test of the Das Keyboard. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think of it.</p>

<p>I bought the <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/" target="_blank">Ultimate S model</a> with the MX Brown switches.  The brown switches are supposed to be the quiet ones, so the idea was that I could use this guy at work, where I&rsquo;m typing for 8 hours a day.</p>

<p>First impression:  There&rsquo;s no way I can use this thing at work.   I&rsquo;m bottoming out&hellip;alot, which makes it exponentially louder than the typical membrane keyboard.</p>

<p>At home, I possibly could get used to using the Das Keyboard.  The sound is kind of nice, but I&rsquo;m hearing a very noticeable reverberation coming from each key press.  I&rsquo;m not sure if this will wear on me over time, or simply become &ldquo;what working sounds like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, I feel like I may end up returning the keyboard because:</p>

<ol><li>$130 is a lot of money.</li>
<li>Even though it&rsquo;s the quiet one, it&rsquo;s still pretty loud.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not yet convinced it will make me a better typist than I already am.</li>
<li>My co-workers would kill me if I used it at work. (Granted I could keep it and use it at home, but at this point I don&rsquo;t use my iMac enough to warrant the expense.</li>
</ol><p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I think the new yearly figure should be overshadowed by the addition of the monthly plan.  It isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I mentioned, instead of utilizing that new, taller screen to give you notifications removed from areas of the phone you regularly need to access (you know, like menus in apps), the notifications continue to pop down over the upper portion of the screen. The result is that you feel trapped, waiting for the message to disappear before you can access buttons you need to get to, or forced to swipe to the left on the message — a hidden function which scurries the dropdown away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Trapped</strong> and <strong>forced</strong> <em>swipe left on the message</em>.  What a burden!</p>

<p>Plus, the swipe gesture isn&rsquo;t really a hidden function. It was clearly stated during the announcement of Notification Center.</p>

<p>Topolsky writes an excellent review, but that observation seems a bit of a stretch.</p>

      <p>If Twitter’s new iPad app would have been released by a different company - or by the company is was 2 years ago - it would have received a much better reception.</p>

<p>Yesterday, many writers destroyed the new design, including <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/18/twitter-ipad" target="_blank">John Gruber</a>, who quoted those like <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/statuses/248161982807699457" target="_blank">Joshua Topolsky</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean let me be perfectly clear: the previous Twitter for iPad was one of the apps you used to show off the iPad. It was awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often I would try that version of Twitter for maybe 1-2 days before becoming fed up and switching back to Tweetbot.  As good as it looked, the sliding panes were often problematic.</p>

<p>I loved the idea of leaving the browser open in the far-right pane, but as soon as I accidentally tapped another tweet, the page would disappear.  I’m much better off sending the link to Instapaper or Safari.</p>

<p>The new iPad app strikes me as one case where the lack of sliding panes tends to work in it’s favor more often than against it.</p>

<p>Twitter’s new iPad is by no means a perfect gem.  It’s a bit jittery, and overall it feels a bit rushed.  Plus, the landscape view is a waste of space, but I <strong>never</strong> use landscape view on any of my iPad apps because they <strong>all</strong> look like a huge waste of space.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/09/18/expand-your-experience" target="_blank">Marco Arment</a> had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After about a year of neglect and many unfixed and embarrassing bugs (introduced after Twitter’s acquisition), Twitter has replaced it with… a blown-up version of their iPhone app. And not even a good one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s less of a blown up version of iPhone app than Tweetbot is.  Whereas many aspects of Tweetbot work exactly the same, like the annoying drawer that appears after tapping a tweet, the Twitter app actually has <em>more</em> inconsistencies across devices.</p>

<p>That’s what is more frustrating about Twitter’s iPhone and iPad app: they simply don’t work well together.  There’s no syncing, and while similar visual elements carry over (just like in Tweetbot), the actual actions do not.  Let’s not even get into the travesty that is the official Mac app.</p>

<p>Still, I think it’s better than the previous model.  I think the current news about Twitter’s apparent disdain for third-party developers has resulted in this backlash from the web.  No matter what they were to release yesterday, it likely would have gotten a similar reaction.</p>

<p>I just worry that, like Marco said, the issue that are still there will take another year (at least) to be ironed out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect Apple will see quite a bit of backlash about this change above all others. But I also expect they’ll iterate their maps pretty quickly. And who knows, maybe we’ll see a Google Maps app pop-up in the App Store, just as we did with a YouTube app.</p>

  <p>It didn’t take long, however, for my initial view to be squashed like a Namibian wildebeest’s eyeball. My first few laps at Chicagoland Speedway in a 190-mph Indy Lights car showcased two key facts of oval racing: 190 mph is batshit crazy. And those walls seem awfully close.</p>
  
  <p>Since then I have been fortunate to have driven 230-mph IndyCars on ovals, and one thing is for sure — the batshit-ness never fades. Even an oval that is “flat-out” the whole way around is never easy. The cars react to the slightest of wind gusts. Every bump attempts to hurl the back end into a spin. Your machine is always on the absolute limit of adhesion. The turbulence following another car is like when Maverick crosses Ice Man’s wake in Top Gun — the car shakes violently and your helmet feels like it will rip your head off.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever the future holds for Squarespace, it’s safe to assume that 3rd party editors will not be supported by Squarespace 6 in the near future. In the mean time, users who already have Squarespace 5 sites should keep their site as it is if they want to continue using MarsEdit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also frustrating is the lack of functionality that Squarespace provides for <strong>their own iOS apps</strong>.  Neither have been updated to retina graphics, plus posting for Squarespace 6 hasn&rsquo;t been updated from version 5.</p>

<p>Thus, your reading this on my old tumblr site.  It works with MarsEdit and Tumblita.  I can live with that.</p>

      <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/09/expand-your-experience-new-twitter-for.html">Twitter for iPad finally gets an update</a><br/><p>This morning, Twitter <em>finally</em> unveiled their new iPad app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today you can download the new Twitter for iPad. We’ve rebuilt the app from the ground up to make it fast, beautiful and easy to use. Twitter for iPad brings you closer to what’s happening all over the world, and makes it easy to keep up with the news you need to read, the photos you want to see and the people you follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed fast, beautiful, and easy to use.  There are a ton of great custom UI decisions here.  I actually like the expanded view that appears whenever I tap on a tweet.  If there&rsquo;s a link in a tweet, the view expands the view to the browser.   It&rsquo;s a really nice touch.</p>

<p>There are still a couple of problems.  Why won&rsquo;t Twitter add some type of syncing support?  If you have apps on various devices, wouldn&rsquo;t you assume that most people would want to sync their timelines?</p>

<p>Plus, I wish there would be more consistency between the iPad and iPhone apps.  The iPhone app doesn&rsquo;t share a similar extended tweet view.  Instead of expanding in the timeline, it slides over to a new window.  That makes it feel a bit dated compared to the iPad&rsquo;s new hotness.</p>

<p>Still, the new iPad is a huge improvement, as I really hated the last version.  It was great to look at, but over time the sliding panes were a huge hassle for me.  If Twitter actually goes forth and kills third party development (I don&rsquo;t think it will), I could see myself using this app.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That a lot&hellip;.wait&hellip;</p>

<p>Iffy reviews? <em>Reviews</em>?</p>

<p>Glad I read the drivel at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duke students sleep for weeks in Krzyzewskiville, the town outside Cameron stadium, to see the team on its home court.</p>
  
  <p>Like Duke&rsquo;s basketball team, Apple inspires devotion and plenty of haters.</p>
  
  <p>Last year, Duke had a miserable March with a quick exit from the NCAA tournament.</p>
  
  <p>For Apple devotees, the question is whether its stock will survive the September iPhone and $700 madness. Not everyone believes the hype.</p>

Keep those extra, extra curated. Scam apps in search results are more difficult to tackle problem, but scam apps in the Top 100, especially in games, is probably manageable. Get a team that knows the biggest classics and the hottest new games, and when something that looks like a scam app shows up in the Top 100, contact the developer and ask for proof of ownership and license, and contact the owner of the original app and inform them of a potential violation of their IP.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping the &ldquo;A5X&rdquo; will make it&rsquo;s way to the Apple TV.</p>

      <a href="http://osfoora.com/mac/">Osfoora for Mac</a><br/><p>I was on the fence about buying Osfoora for Mac.  I like the iOS version, but for whatever reason it never impressed me enough to stay on my home screen.  I decided to go ahead and buy the Mac version, and I&rsquo;m really glad that I did.</p>
<p>With most apps, especially Twitter apps, I can usually tell within a few minutes if I&rsquo;ll actually keep it around.  Osfoora has a really nice graphical trick up it&rsquo;s sleeve:  Each time I click on a different pane on the left side of the window (say, &ldquo;mentions&rdquo; or &ldquo;messages&rdquo;), the window slides into view from the left, <em>inertially,</em> and bounces into frame.  Clicking on a profile cause a similar action, instead from the right.</p>
<p>I love it when developers take the time to implement these little UI tricks.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2010/07/21/long-live-my-9700.html">Long Live My 9700</a></h1>

      <p>A few days ago I bought a new phone:  the Samsung Captivate. At first was very excited; I would have a full featured webkit browser, a giant 4-inch screen, and the rapidly-growing Android software ecosystem.    After my first day with the phone, the problems started to stack up quickly.</p>
<p>First, the phone had a maddening problem with lag. Searching was a bit of a nightmare; after clicking the search button, there was a very long pause while the phone tried to bounce from search to either contacts or the browser.  Sometimes the apps would stall completely, and since there are no hardware buttons, it was hard to tell if the phone was registering my &ldquo;home&rdquo; or &ldquo;back&rdquo; commands.</p>
<p>After 5 days of use, I happily took the Captivate back to the ATT store for a refund. Now I&rsquo;m typing this post on my Blackberry 9700. I&rsquo;m going to wait anxiously for their next big thing: the 9800. I&rsquo;ll leave with a few more thoughts that helped my decision:</p>
<p>-Most of the Android apps really suck. They take forever to open and just seem really half baked. There isn&rsquo;t a single twitter app that can match the greatness of the mighty Ubertwitter for Blackberry. (In my opinion, this applies for every other mobile OS as well)</p>
<p>-Multitasking is pretty bad. Apps that are open tend to drain the battery at an alarming speed. I downloaded Advanced Task Manager to help kill unwanted apps, but this just seemed like a pretty bad solution. With the 9700, I can simply close the app by clicking &ldquo;close&rdquo; or &ldquo;exit&rdquo;. Simple as that. Also the 9700 has superior battery life, which is mostly related to screen size, but important nonetheless.</p>
<p>-The 9700 is a superior phone. It has 5 bars where the Captivate has 3, vastly superior call quality, and text messaging is a breeze. The Captivate didn&rsquo;t even come close in terms of basic communication.</p>

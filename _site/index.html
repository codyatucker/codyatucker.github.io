      <p>Horrific numbers from a Harvard Study, detailed by The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.</p>

  <p>The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that health-care disruption for the elderly and the loss of basic utility services for the chronically ill had significant impacts across the U.S. territory, which was thrown into chaos after the September hurricane wiped out the electrical grid and had widespread impacts on infrastructure. Some communities were entirely cut off for weeks amid road closures and communications failures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Puerto Rico was hardly prepared to take on the response to the storm, but the federal government didn’t appear to be up for it either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital — only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.</p>

  <p>The new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government’s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.</p>

  <p>Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.</p>

      <p>Testing the new keyboard. It’s a new Magicforce 68, replacing the Daskeyboard Ultimate that I’ve used since around 2012.</p>

<p>The Magicforce seems nosier than the Das. The new board has Gateron Brown keys, which are supposed to copy the heralded Cherry MX Brown. Upon first use, I think I prefer the real Cherry MX Brown. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Otherwise the form factor is much, much better. Not even close, really. The Magicforce even includes media keys—accessible by the Fn key—which is a huge upgrade from the Das.</p>

      <p>Jon Russell at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/mediums-latest-pivot-leaves-some-independent-media-in-the-lurch/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them a week’s notice on the shutdown. Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.</p>

  <p>A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting all of these “build your own platform” arguments aside, this move should have a serious impact on Medium’s credibility—not just as a service or a platform—but as a company.</p>

      Jeff Cohen and Norman Soloman for Fair.org in 1995:

<blockquote>
  <p>What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).</p>

  <p>An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.</p>

  <p>Inmates in solitary confinement at Snake River spend 23 hours a day in cells with no windows to the outside world; their outside-the-cell time is spent in a concrete-enclosed exercise room.</p>

  <p>But during the course of Nadkarni’s one-year study, half of the 48 prisoners in a solitary cellblock got to watch nature videos of their choosing projected on a wall in the room during the 45 to 60 minutes they spent there each day.</p>

  <p>The videos projected in what inmates called the &ldquo;blue room&rdquo; included imagery of forests, beaches, and Earth viewed from space. Inmates in the other half of the cellblock took their exercise time as usual, without being exposed to any nature videos.</p>

  <p>What happened? According to surveys and interviews conducted at the conclusion of the study, 43 percent of the inmates who were allowed to watch the nature videos said the videos soothed them. “When I first went into the blue room, I was like ‘wow, how beautiful this world is,’” one of the inmates said.</p>

<p>Even worse, the Post says no evacuation order was issued in Houston. That’ll raise questions about the city’s storm preps, but save that for later. This event is expected to play out over the next several days, and it looks progressively dire as it develops.</p>

  <p>First, Like and Retweet counts update dynamically, so you can see instantly the engagement generated by a tweet.</p>

  <p>Second, you can add filters and stickers to your profile photo.</p>

  <p>Third, and most welcome of all, links now open in Safari instead of Twitter’s own browser. This means that you’re now logged into websites where you have an account. It also provides access to Reader View.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks a lot better than the previous app, and I can&rsquo;t believe it took so long to implement Safari View Controller. Still, there&rsquo;s a lot of text everywhere all the time, and it remains too hard to access lists, which I use now more than ever.</p>

<p>Both Tweetbot and Twitteriffic allow me to set tabs at the bottom of the screen for quick access feeds dedicated to news, soccer, tech and automotive news. For example, this allows me to keep the minute-to-minute noise of the news cycle outside of my main feed, yet it&rsquo;s always available the second I want to dive in. List support adds a remarkable layer of depth to the Twitter experience, and the service is significantly less useful without it.</p>

<p>I adore my iPhone SE. I upgraded from a 6 Plus, and despite the massive change is screen size, I quickly adjusted to the SE thanks to it&rsquo;s perfect form factor. Despite lacking some high-level features, it&rsquo;s simply remarkable how powerful and capable this phone is at the price point. It&rsquo;s easily my favorite iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple may be on it&rsquo;s way to creating it&rsquo;s next all-time greatest phone, but it&rsquo;s going to have to do serious work if it wants to beat the SE.</p>

      <p>Natasha Singer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products — effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.</p>

  <p>Today, more than half the nation’s primary- and secondary-school students — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America’s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.</p>

  <p>“Between the fall of 2012 and now, Google went from an interesting possibility to the dominant way that schools around the country” teach students to find information, create documents and turn them in, said Hal Friedlander, former chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education, the nation’s largest school district. “Google established itself as a fact in schools.”</p>

  <p>The tech giants, who are increasingly competing for customers’ time, eyeballs and money, are close to an agreement to bring an Amazon video app to Apple’s Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the two companies.</p>

  <p>Amazon employees expect the app to show up on Apple’s hardware in the third quarter of the year.</p>

  <p>That move would allow Amazon Prime Video subscribers to easily watch TV shows and movies from the service using Apple TV.</p>

  <p>For the past few years, Amazon subscribers have only been able to watch their shows on Apple TV using Apple’s comparatively cumbersome Airplay system, which involves connecting another Apple product, like an iPhone, to an Apple TV using a Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV won the battle for my living room last year thanks to a very nice Playstation Vue app along with the access to Prime video content. The Apple TV was relegated to the bedroom TV, but in that time it&rsquo;s added a solid Vue (though it&rsquo;s hampered a bit by Apple&rsquo;s remote).</p>

  <p>But! Wait! There&rsquo;s a bunch of things wrong with this Trump tweet.
  The most obvious is that the media didn&rsquo;t create the idea of the first 100 days as an important moment, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did. Roosevelt saw the first 100 days of his term in 1933 as an absolutely essential moment to re-build momentum and optimism in a country that was still reeling from the Great Depression.

  <p>“How many people work for government in the United States?” he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. “Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?”</p>

  <p>“Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’” Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. “Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.” And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.</p>

  <p>“And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?” Mr. Ballmer continued. “Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.”</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste suddenly start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.</p>

  <p>“Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,” Mr. Ballmer said.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also amazing that they managed two goals in a 3-2 loss, leaving them with a chance to overcome the deficit in two weeks in the second leg in Monaco.</p>

  <p>“We’ve given up. It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed,” Brodie said. “Even though we’ve spent a lot of money, we’ve had no success.”</p>

  <p>Brodie used strong language to describe the threats to the reef in 2017. He said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated.</p>

  <p>“Last year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,” Brodie said. “The federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programs, the water quality management is having very limited success. It’s unsuccessful.”</p>

  <p>This is no little thing. Describing Mar-a-Lago in a news article as “the so-called Winter White House” is normalizing out and out corruption — Trump’s shameless profiteering off the presidency.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m really excited about this. I recently made Twitterrific by main iOS Twitter app, and I&rsquo;d love to see developers bring a similar experience to the Mac.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similar to what has been offered by third-party Twitter clients for sometime, users will be able to hide tweets from specific users or tweets that contain certain keywords from ever appearing in their timeline …</p>

  <p>The Twitter app added muting features for notifications at the end of last year. It will shortly roll out the same capabilities to the home timeline.</p>

  <p>The Twitter app will also include options to hide users that don’t have a profile photo, cutting down abuse from so-called ‘egg accounts’ which typically retain anonymity by using the default Twitter profile pictures. There will also be settings to mute accounts that use unverified contact information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how people were able to go so long using Twitter&rsquo;s stock app <em>without</em> mute filters.</p>

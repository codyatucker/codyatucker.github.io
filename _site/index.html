      <p>Bad headline, first of all, as Bradley Chambers is mainly arguing for better input options in the iPad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine being able to work in a native WordPress or Squarespace interface on an iPad with an external keyboard and trackpad? Imagine being able to use the full web version of Google Docs instead of the sub-par iPad apps? Imagine being able to do precise text selection on an iPad. This is what the iPad needs software wise. While touch-based interfaces have brought a lot of great innovations, I still struggle, ergonomically, to use them for hours as a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, I really don’t understand why 9to5Mac went with this headline. Anyways, <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2018/06/mobile-safari-is-holding-the-ipad-back/">Ben Brooks</a> makes a good case for Apple holding it’s ground here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because some product manager decided that their support response would be “use a desktop, sorry”. I don’t want iPad to have a cursor, because that’s not what iPad is. I want websites to pull their heads out of their asses and realize that there are far more people using mobile Safari than there are those sitting down at a desktop to work. Just as web designers had to learn to design responsive websites mobile first, web application developers need to make their apps work on iPhones and Android phones first and foremost, desktops second. Because if it works on an iPhone, it will certainly work on a MacBook Pro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple is in a very strong position here, with so many devices in the world running mobile Safari. It helps that mobile Safari is arguably one of the best web browsers in the world.</p>

<p>Chambers is a correct that Apple needs to keep working on interface solutions that offer <em>something</em> to improve ergonomics in key areas—particularly for people with “laptop-like” use cases.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Apple is taking great care before adding traditional interface tools to iOS. Once they add cursor/trackpad inputs, they can’t really turn back, and doing so would risk limiting progress with touch interfaces as users revert to whatever is comfortable to them.</p>

      <p>Glenn Kessler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there’s a problem: This is not a verified number, unlike body counts in wars. The Harvard study offers only an estimate – a midpoint along a broad range of possibilities. It is not based on death records, only estimates of deaths from people who were interviewed in a survey.</p>

  <p>In effect, the researchers took one number – 15 deaths identified from a survey of 3,299 households – and extrapolated that to come up with 4,645 deaths across the island. That number came with a very large caveat, clearly identified in the report, but few news media accounts bothered to explain the nuances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harvard’s estimated toll was “a 95% confidence interval of 793 to 8,498, and 4,645 falls in the middle of this range.”</p>

<p>Four other studies estimated the death toll between 605 and 1,194, but Harvard’s study was quite different compared to the earlier ones.</p>

<p>The quoted piece makes a good case that the actual death toll is closer to the earlier studies, and on the lower end of Harvard’s estimate interval.</p>

<p>That’s still a catastrophic loss of life from a disaster that doesn’t get enough attention.</p>

      <p>Peter Bright:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By way of comparison, the previous update, version 1709 (“Fall Creators Update”) took about two months to reach 50 percent penetration, and the one before that, version 1703 (“Creators Update”) took around three months to reach the same level.</p>

  <p>The faster rollout suggests greater confidence within Microsoft that the update is relatively problem-free. Version 1803 hasn’t been immune to issues—it was blocked temporarily from installation on systems with certain SSDs—but the speed of the rollout suggests that it has avoided any major issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great sign for Microsoft. Updating a Windows 10 machine is a far better experience than Windows 7. It’s also clear that users trust it to not make massively unsettling changes to their daily workflow, and the brisk adoption rate <em>should</em> aid security of a large swath of PC’s around the world.</p>

      <p>Sarah Perez:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Messages in iCloud was first announced a year ago at WWDC 2017 as a way of keeping conversations up-to-date across all your Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac. Its introduction means you’ll now be able to access your entire Messages history when you set up a new Apple device, and, when you delete a message from one device, that change syncs to all your devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Storing messages in iCloud should help clear up loads of space on device.</p>

<p>More importantly, this highly-sensitive data appears to be stored securely, ensuring that no one—including Apple—can access this data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The messages are also end-to-end encrypted for security purposes. They’re protected with a key derived from information unique to the device, combined with the device passcode – which only the device owner should know. That means no one else could access or read the data.</p>

      <p>Horrific numbers from a Harvard Study, detailed by The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.</p>

  <p>The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that health-care disruption for the elderly and the loss of basic utility services for the chronically ill had significant impacts across the U.S. territory, which was thrown into chaos after the September hurricane wiped out the electrical grid and had widespread impacts on infrastructure. Some communities were entirely cut off for weeks amid road closures and communications failures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Puerto Rico was hardly prepared to take on the response to the storm, but the federal government didn’t appear to be up for it either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital — only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.</p>

  <p>The new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government’s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.</p>

  <p>Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.</p>

      <p>Testing the new keyboard. It’s a new Magicforce 68, replacing the Daskeyboard Ultimate that I’ve used since around 2012.</p>

<p>The Magicforce seems nosier than the Das. The new board has Gateron Brown keys, which are supposed to copy the heralded Cherry MX Brown. Upon first use, I think I prefer the real Cherry MX Brown. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Otherwise the form factor is much, much better. Not even close, really. The Magicforce even includes media keys—accessible by the Fn key—which is a huge upgrade from the Das.</p>

      <p>Jon Russell at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/mediums-latest-pivot-leaves-some-independent-media-in-the-lurch/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them a week’s notice on the shutdown. Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.</p>

  <p>A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting all of these “build your own platform” arguments aside, this move should have a serious impact on Medium’s credibility—not just as a service or a platform—but as a company.</p>

      Jeff Cohen and Norman Soloman for Fair.org in 1995:

<blockquote>
  <p>What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).</p>

  <p>An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.</p>

  <p>Inmates in solitary confinement at Snake River spend 23 hours a day in cells with no windows to the outside world; their outside-the-cell time is spent in a concrete-enclosed exercise room.</p>

  <p>But during the course of Nadkarni’s one-year study, half of the 48 prisoners in a solitary cellblock got to watch nature videos of their choosing projected on a wall in the room during the 45 to 60 minutes they spent there each day.</p>

  <p>The videos projected in what inmates called the &ldquo;blue room&rdquo; included imagery of forests, beaches, and Earth viewed from space. Inmates in the other half of the cellblock took their exercise time as usual, without being exposed to any nature videos.</p>

  <p>What happened? According to surveys and interviews conducted at the conclusion of the study, 43 percent of the inmates who were allowed to watch the nature videos said the videos soothed them. “When I first went into the blue room, I was like ‘wow, how beautiful this world is,’” one of the inmates said.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It looks a lot better than the previous app, and I can&rsquo;t believe it took so long to implement Safari View Controller. Still, there&rsquo;s a lot of text everywhere all the time, and it remains too hard to access lists, which I use now more than ever.</p>

<p>Both Tweetbot and Twitteriffic allow me to set tabs at the bottom of the screen for quick access feeds dedicated to news, soccer, tech and automotive news. For example, this allows me to keep the minute-to-minute noise of the news cycle outside of my main feed, yet it&rsquo;s always available the second I want to dive in. List support adds a remarkable layer of depth to the Twitter experience, and the service is significantly less useful without it.</p>

It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products — effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.</p>

  <p>Today, more than half the nation’s primary- and secondary-school students — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America’s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.</p>

  <p>“Between the fall of 2012 and now, Google went from an interesting possibility to the dominant way that schools around the country” teach students to find information, create documents and turn them in, said Hal Friedlander, former chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education, the nation’s largest school district. “Google established itself as a fact in schools.”</p>

      <p>Recode&rsquo;s Peter Kafka and Jason Del Ray:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tech giants, who are increasingly competing for customers’ time, eyeballs and money, are close to an agreement to bring an Amazon video app to Apple’s Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the two companies.</p>

  <p>Amazon employees expect the app to show up on Apple’s hardware in the third quarter of the year.</p>

  <p>That move would allow Amazon Prime Video subscribers to easily watch TV shows and movies from the service using Apple TV.</p>

  <p>For the past few years, Amazon subscribers have only been able to watch their shows on Apple TV using Apple’s comparatively cumbersome Airplay system, which involves connecting another Apple product, like an iPhone, to an Apple TV using a Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV won the battle for my living room last year thanks to a very nice Playstation Vue app along with the access to Prime video content. The Apple TV was relegated to the bedroom TV, but in that time it&rsquo;s added a solid Vue (though it&rsquo;s hampered a bit by Apple&rsquo;s remote).</p>

<p>With the addition of Amazon Video, the Apple TV may get a run at my living room again. I still love the Fire TV, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/16/amazon-fire-tvs-new-look-arrives-today/" target="_blank">new interface released in December</a> didn&rsquo;t do much for me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But! Wait! There&rsquo;s a bunch of things wrong with this Trump tweet.
  The most obvious is that the media didn&rsquo;t create the idea of the first 100 days as an important moment, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did. Roosevelt saw the first 100 days of his term in 1933 as an absolutely essential moment to re-build momentum and optimism in a country that was still reeling from the Great Depression. He helped pass 15 major pieces of legislation through a willing Congress.</p>

      <p>Andrew Ross Sorkin writing on Ballmer&rsquo;s new &ldquo;data trove&rdquo; aimed and tracking how tax money is spent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many people work for government in the United States?” he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. “Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?”</p>

  <p>“Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’” Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. “Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.” And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.</p>

  <p>“And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?” Mr. Ballmer continued. “Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.”</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste suddenly start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.</p>

  <p>“Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,” Mr. Ballmer said.</p>

    <p>Apple finally unveiled the fabled retina iMac. It&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/specs/" target="_blank">iMac with Retina 5K display</a>, featuring a 5120x2880 resolution. It&rsquo;s insane, and it starts $2499. $500 less than the Mac Pro&rsquo;s starting price.</p>

<p>Along with the amazing display is the iMac many of us know and love. I have a 2011 base 21.5&quot; model and it&rsquo;s the best computer that I&rsquo;ve ever owned. I&rsquo;ve always felt that the 27-inch display was a little too big for me, so I went with the &ldquo;small&rdquo; one and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>

<p>On today&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeLzZxSkmOs" target="_blank">5by5 Special</a>, Dan Benjamin, Victor Agreda Jr. and Adam Cristianson discuss the newest iMac, and ponder why Apple didn&rsquo;t come out with a new Retina Display alongside the all-in-one. One argument centers around the fact that Apple has a lot of Mac Pro owners clamoring for precisely that, but for whatever reason, it&rsquo;s not available. There&rsquo;s a group of customers standing with their wallets open, ready to throw money at the company, yet Apple is still holding off.</p>

<p>I think Apple&rsquo;s reasoning fairly simple. It probably costs a lot of time, money and resources to make this display. Apple wanted to get it to market as soon as possible, and the tech was there at a price they could handle; but at 27-inches, they probably had to choose between putting it atop the iMac lineup, or ushering in a new era of killer external displays.</p>

<p>My theory, based on absolutely nothing, is that Apple engineers and executives faced on simple question: <em>How best can we show this amazing display to the world for the first time?</em></p>

<p>Have you ever seen a Mac Pro sitting inside an Apple Store? It looks amazing, for sure, but it&rsquo;s usually setting there alone while a huge crowd pokes around on iMacs and MacBooks. They&rsquo;ll marvel at the sheer size of the 27-inch iMac before they even notice the little black trashcan. They&rsquo;ll also marvel at the Macbook Pro with Retina Display. They might even pick it up to marvel at how Apple could possibly fit so much power and beauty in such a small and light package.</p>

<p>Now, those same people can walk up to an unassuming 27-inch iMac at the corner of the display table. They&rsquo;ll turn it on, and suddenly this incredible Retina 5K display lights up in front of them. They may not buy this particular model. Not yet. But now, it&rsquo;s on their mind. And it will stay there, because as <a href="http://macsparky.com" target="_blank">David Sparks</a> said a time or two, if you look at a Mac with a Retina Display, it could very well spoil every display you&rsquo;ll ever lay your eyes on. It really is that good (I&rsquo;m clearly paraphrasing).</p>

<p>If Apple would have first shipped a 27-inch Retina 5K Display and plugged it into a display Mac Pro, a vast majority of current and existing customers simply wouldn&rsquo;t notice. It would have never piqued their interest.</p>

<p>Now obviously, a $2,500 computer is clearly marketed for power users. Apple surely knew this. They probably also thought,  <em>Why have a $3000+ computer alongside an approx. $2000 display, when we can make a separate $2500+ computer that fits nearly every need of nearly every customer on Earth?</em></p>

<p>The Mac Pro is great and all, but why buy it when you can spec out a killer iMac with a 27-inch Retina 5K display. Mac Pro users have their needs, and they will surely get an Apple display of their own someday. For now, there&rsquo;s far more business that can be done with a killer iMac.</p>

    <p>The naming of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/index1.html" target="_blank">iPad Air</a> is telling.  Apple knows the iPad is much more than an accessory device. It is a legitimate personal computer with lots of horsepower in tap; all while still being simple enough for just about everyone in the world figure out.</p>

<p>Thus, it only makes sense to continue moving iPad away from the &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; naming convention and over to the &ldquo;serious computer&rdquo; side of the spectrum. I only hope the iPhone soon follows.</p>

<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank">Mavericks</a> a half hour before this writing, but I haven&rsquo;t delved much into it, mostly because I simply spend so much more time on my iOS devices.  The iPad is:</p>

<ul><li>where I read everything</li>
<li>where I write <em>almost</em> everything, and</li>
<li>where I play and record guitar</li>
</ul><p>My 2012 base iMac is much more powerful but it&rsquo;s increasingly becoming the device that I tell myself to use, while the iPad is not just my first choice, it&rsquo;s my first instinct.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently using an iPad 3 and it&rsquo;s just as excellent as the day I used it. I&rsquo;m torn between the iPad Air and the top end <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/index1.html" target="_blank">iPad Mini</a>. I think I would go with the Air simply because it&rsquo;s only a quarter of a pound heavier, so there&rsquo;s less incentive to switch to the smaller screen.</p>

<p>Whenever I can afford a new iPad, there may be one thing holding me back: Touch ID.</p>

<p>I tend to think of the iPhone as a 2 year proposition. As soon as the contract is up, I&rsquo;m due for the next iPhone which will surely have Touch ID.</p>

<p>I think of the iPad as a much longer deal, and as soon as I get an iPhone with Touch ID, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll want it on every single Apple device I own. Maybe it would be wise for me to wait one more year before upgrading from my trusty 3.</p>

    <p>Since <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/new/" target="_blank">Nintendo launched the 2DS</a>, there has been lots of talk over the future of the company and how it should move forward in a world full of smartphones and tablets, all pining for the attention and adoration of the world’s young people.  As it stands, it <em>appears</em> that post-PC devices are winning that fight. But it doesn’t mean Nintendo is out of the game</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/more_on_nintendo" target="_blank">John Gruber argues that Nintendo should join them, since they can’t beat them</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future of portable gaming is clearly on post-PC computing platforms. (The future of living room gaming may well rest on these platforms, too.) A dedicated camera takes better photographs. A Mac or Windows laptop is far more powerful for numerous computing tasks. A simple dumb phone will last for a month on a single charge. An iPod makes for a lighter weight, more durable music player. Yet all these things are losing sales to iOS and Android post-PC devices. DS-style  handheld gaming platforms are no different, and perhaps in a worse situation than the others. Priced for the low-end (like the upcoming 2DS) and they pale in terms of graphics. Compete on graphics and they pale in terms of price compared to carrier-subsidized phones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other arguments suggest Nintendo should stay the course, citing its ability to consistently survive threats from powerful opponents all by itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/09/02/nintendo-in-crisis" target="_blank">John Siracusa has made the best argument for this option</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The game software business is tough. It’s hit-driven, like Hollywood. Most games lose money or break even. A few big winners fund all the others—if you’re lucky. A game development studio going out of business shortly after releasing a critically acclaimed game is not unheard of. (Hell, the best game released last *year bankrupted its developer.)</p>
  
  <p>Consolidation is rampant in game development. Small players are routinely snatched up by behemoths that have a better capacity to absorb the inevitable losses that come with games that are not monster sales successes.</p>
  
  <p>This is not a world that Nintendo should aspire to enter. Better to stick with hardware platforms that it controls, profiting from both the hardware sales and the fees collected from third-party games sold on its platforms. That’s the kind of steady (and potentially enormous) income that will keep Nintendo afloat as it works on the next big thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both are excellent arguments, but all the talk has left me thinking one thing: <em>I kind of really want to buy a Nintendo 2DS, maybe</em>.  I never cared for the 3D, I think it looks great, it features a bazillion games, several that I wouldn’t mind playing, and it’s almost priced right ($99 would have sealed the deal).</p>

<p>Any talk, be it positive or negative about Nintendo and its situation, is good for Nintendo.  Perhaps that in some way confirms both sides of the argument.</p>

<p>It’s great that the great tech minds are debating Nintendo, because before the debate began, I hadn’t thought about buying its handheld for at least 2 years.  Now, it’s at the very least on my radar.</p>

<p>The problem is, only the great tech pundits are postulating the decisions of Nintendo, not the mainstream.</p>

<p>If Nintendo can cross that divide, I think they’ll weather the storm and strike it big again, like Siracusa says. If not, as Gruber says, perhaps it’s best to “join em”.</p>

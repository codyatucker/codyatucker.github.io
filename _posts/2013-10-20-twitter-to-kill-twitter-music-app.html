<blockquote>
  <p>The scrapping of Twitter #Music, when it occurs, marks a clear misstep in the company’s online music strategy, which has lacked direction over the past year. The app was atypically developed in isolation inside the company. It was a sort of a skunkworks project led by former Twitter business development leader Kevin Thau, and built by the team behind “We Are Hunted,” a company Twitter acquired to work on music products. Twitter #Music, according to people familiar with its development, was never fully integrated with the overall product team as it was being built.</p>

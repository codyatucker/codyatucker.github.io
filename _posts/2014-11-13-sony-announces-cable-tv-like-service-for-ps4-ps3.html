<blockquote>
  <p>PlayStation Vue will launch with a package of &ldquo;around 75 channels per market,&rdquo; said Sony. That includes local broadcast networks as well as cable channels from media companies such as Fox, NBCUniversal and Viacom. On-demand content will also be a part of the service, with the previous three days of &ldquo;popular programming&rdquo; available at all times, plus the ability for viewers to save episodes of their favorite shows to the cloud and retain access for up to 28 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of channels are onboard; seemingly everyone <em>but</em> Disney and Turner. It&rsquo;s set to arrive later this year, but only to a handful of markets before a larger rollout. We&rsquo;ll see how this turns out.</p>

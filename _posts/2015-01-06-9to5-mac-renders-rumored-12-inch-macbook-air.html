<a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/">9to5 Mac renders rumored 12-inch Macbook Air</a><br/><p>Big scoop from 9to5 Mac. If it turns out to be true, Apple will drop Thunderbolt and MagSafe standards in favor of USB-C:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the left side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the right side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.</p>

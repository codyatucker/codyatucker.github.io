<blockquote>
  <p>The patient news was discovered and documented by the MIT Technology Review, who point out that the distinction for posthumous patent awarding might now be exactly what it may seem. While Jobs was indeed an innovator, often the placement of his name on a patent had to do with his work on smaller details of a design, fine tuning things others might not think about.</p>

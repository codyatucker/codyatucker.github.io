<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3042435/steves-legacy-tim-looks-ahead">The importance of Apple's new campus</a><br/><p>This bit stuck out to me in the aforementioned <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3042435/steves-legacy-tim-looks-ahead" target="_blank">Fast Company interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We didn’t predict our employee growth, so we haven’t had a campus that houses everyone. We are spread out in hundreds of buildings, and none of us like that; we hate it. Now we’ll be able to work primarily at that one campus. So, yeah, I’m totally behind that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground" target="_blank">Much has been said</a> about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/01/05/functional-high-ground" target="_blank">the issue</a> of the perceived degradation of Apple&rsquo;s software compatibility across multiple devices. It&rsquo;s happened as Apple has grown at a rapid pace in the past decade.</p>

<p>Is it possible that things will get (much) better when Apple has all of its employees in one facility?</p>

<p>I took the Das and my Apple USB Keyboard to work today.</p>

<p>Today’s impression:  I love the gastly Das.</p>

<p>A little bit of time really does make a difference.  While at first I kept “bottoming out” while typing with the Das, things seems to click yesterday.  I began trusting the keyboard to register at the proper point, proving how much less energy is needed to press the key.  It’s a <em>huge</em> difference.</p>

<p>I typed quite a lot from 1:30pm to 10:00pm today.  Even at the end of the day, I still felt good about typing on the Das.  I have completely come around to that ugly thing.</p>

<p>It’s also not as loud as I had anticipated.  It’s probably louder than other keyboards around me, but it’s a noisy environment, so I don’t think it will be a problem.</p>

<p>I left the Das at work, and now I miss it.  I may have to hunt down a ten-keyless clicky keyboard now.</p>

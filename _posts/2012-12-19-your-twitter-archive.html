<a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html?m=1">Your Twitter Archive</a><br/><p>Great news from the Twitter Blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, we’re introducing the ability to download your Twitter archive, so you’ll get all your Tweets (including Retweets) going back to the beginning. Once you have your Twitter archive, you can view your Tweets by month, or search your archive to find Tweets with certain words, phrases, hashtags or @usernames. You can even engage with your old Tweets just as you would with current ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip;and very good timing.</p>

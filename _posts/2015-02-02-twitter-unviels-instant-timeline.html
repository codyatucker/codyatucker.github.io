<blockquote>
  <p>Over all, however, the quality of the instant timeline was so good that I was almost tempted to dump my regular Twitter account, where I follow more than 700 other accounts, probably one-third of which are no longer important to me.</p>
  
  <p>That isnâ€™t quite what Twitter has in mind. The company says the power of Twitter comes from fine-tuning it to follow the people and topics that you are most interested in.</p>
  
  <p>The instant timeline has frequent reminders urging you to follow people, including one that stayed at the top of my feed for quite a while. It also has built-in tutorials at strategic points to explain concepts like direct messaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting idea. I like that they&rsquo;re trying to make it as easy as possible to sign up, while still urging people to customize the experience to their liking.</p>

<p>Chris Cillizza:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But! Wait! There&rsquo;s a bunch of things wrong with this Trump tweet.
  The most obvious is that the media didn&rsquo;t create the idea of the first 100 days as an important moment, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did. Roosevelt saw the first 100 days of his term in 1933 as an absolutely essential moment to re-build momentum and optimism in a country that was still reeling from the Great Depression. He helped pass 15 major pieces of legislation through a willing Congress.</p>

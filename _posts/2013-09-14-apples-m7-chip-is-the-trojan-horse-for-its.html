<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OmMalik/~3/VjyEjeUHcaQ/">Apple’s M7 chip is the Trojan Horse for its wearable computing plans</a><br/><p>Chris Brandrick also envisions the M7 showing up in other devices, namely the one on your wrist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually this new chip will inevitably make its way into a range of other products across the iOS product line, with it growing the number of supported apps. In due course, there will likely be a number of apps that a companion device — namely a wrist-worn gadget of some form — could support.</p>
  
  <p>It may not be a watch, but imagine a FuelBand or FitBit-esque (see disclosure), Apple-designed wrist companion device — M7 chip included — tracking your motion without the need to remember “Is my phone in my pocket?” Heading over to the restroom or leaving the office to make a coffee may seem like small granular activities, but to die-hard app trackers, say for those using a pedometer app, it all adds up. With some form of wrist device, it doesn’t matter if your phone skips the journey and stays at your desk.</p>

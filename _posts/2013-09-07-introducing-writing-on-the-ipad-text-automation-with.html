<blockquote>
  <p>“Writing On The iPad: Text Automation with Editorial” contains my review of Editorial with an in-depth explanation and critique of the app’s numerous features and workflow tools. My goal with this book is to provide a convenient, portable resource to learn more about Editorial, how the app changed the way I work on iOS, and how, through Editorial’s automation, scripts, and workflows, it’s possible to turn an iPad into a powerful tool for writers.</p>

<p>I wrote the previous post in Editorial.  It&rsquo;s definitely not the first post I&rsquo;ve ever written on iPad, with Byword being been my go-to writing app. But now, <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/" target="_blank">Editorial</a> does so much more without getting in the way of what&rsquo;s most important.</p>

<p>I just started reading the book (I actually bought it <em>before</em> I bought the app itself), and I&rsquo;m only scratching the surface of what it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;it’s interesting to notice how The Wall Street Journal says the <span class="caps">LTE </span>iPad 3 will provide a good testing opportunity for carriers, whereas most carriers worldwide are still far behind in the <span class="caps">LTE </span>rollout for consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would say the same domestically.  I haven&rsquo;t even had the pleasure to enjoy <span class="caps">HSPA</span>+. The area from which I grew up was finally upgraded to 3G <span class="caps">LAST YEAR.</span></p>

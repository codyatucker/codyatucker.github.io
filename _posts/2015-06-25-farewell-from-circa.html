<a href="http://www.circanews.com/news/goodbye">"Farewell, from Circa"</a><br/><p>Bad news on the front page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&rsquo;s with great disappointment that we let you know that Circa News has been put on indefinite hiatus. Producing high-quality news can be a costly endeavor and without the capital necessary to support further production we are unable to continue.</p>
  
  <p>Our mission was always to create a news company where factual, unbiased, and succinct information could be found. In doing so we recognized that building a revenue stream for such a mission would take some time and chose to rely on venture capital to sustain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad. I routinely checked Circa for both a roundup of the day&rsquo;s news, along with a deeper dive into big issues around the world. Best of luck to their journalists.</p>

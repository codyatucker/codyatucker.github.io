<a href="http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/2/video/3102522/watch-nuri-sahin-gets-emotional-speaking-about-attack">ESPN: Nuri Sahin gets emotional speaking about attack</a><br/><p>Though the logistics of rescheduling this game would have been impossible, there&rsquo;s no way the Dortmund players were in any way emotionally prepared to play a Champions League match on the day after their bus was apparently attacked by some sort of explosive.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also amazing that they managed two goals in a 3-2 loss, leaving them with a chance to overcome the deficit in two weeks in the second leg in Monaco.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, we are dropping the Member price from $50/year to $36/year. All existing members will get the benefits of the yearly price drop. Existing members will get additional months added to their plan so that they see the same pricing benefits that new yearly members get. If you are an existing member, you should have received an email from us explaining the extra time that has been added to your subscription.</p>

<p>I think the new yearly figure should be overshadowed by the addition of the monthly plan.  It isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The option of a monthly plan could work great as a trial, whereas the previous model made it difficult for users to &ldquo;dive in&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DURANT, Okla. (AP) â€” Calling the Internet a 21st century necessity, President Barack Obama on Wednesday unveiled a program to bring faster Internet connections to more low-income households, particularly to help students living in public and assisted housing stay ahead in school.</p>
  
  <p>Under ConnectHome, the public, private and nonprofit sectors have pledged to work together to provide high-speed connections and digital devices to more families at lower cost.</p>
  
  <p>More than 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate have Internet access, Obama said. But fewer than half of low-income households have similar access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent move to frame it primarily as an education issue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ConnectHome is similar to ConnectEd, a federal program that Obama said is on track to wire 99 percent of K-12 classrooms and libraries with high-speed Internet by the end of 2017.</p>
  
  <p>ConnectHome will begin in 27 cities and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Durant. With about 200,000 members spread across much of southeastern Oklahoma, the Choctaw Nation is the nation&rsquo;s third-largest Native American tribe.</p>
  
  <p>The Choctaw Nation was also among the administration&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Promise Zones,&rdquo; a designation that makes it eligible for tax incentives and grants to help fight poverty.</p>
  
  <p>The only federal money expected to be spent on ConnectHome is a $50,000 Agriculture Department grant to the Choctaw Nation, officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip;and it avoids the Republican&rsquo;s usual trope of &ldquo;BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDING!&rdquo;</p>

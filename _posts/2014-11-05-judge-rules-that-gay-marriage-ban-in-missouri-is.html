<blockquote>
  <p>Denying Missouri&rsquo;s gay couples the opporutnity to marry is unconstitutional, a judge ruled this afternoon.</p>
  
  <p>As a result, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison said in his decision, marriage licenses can be issued.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;The Court finds and declares that any same sex couple that satisfies all the requirements for marriage under Missouri law, other than being of different sexes, is legally entitled to a marriage license,&rdquo; Burlison wrote.</p>
  
  <p>He said that the Missouri Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher">'I always felt sorry for her children'</a><br/><p>Russell Brand on the death of Margaret Thatcher:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It always struck me as peculiar, too, when the Spice Girls briefly championed Thatcher as an early example of girl power. I don’t see that. She is an anomaly; a product of the freak-onomy of her time. Barack Obama, interestingly, said in his statement that she had “broken the glass ceiling for other women”. Only in the sense that all the women beneath her were blinded by falling shards. She is an icon of individualism, not of feminism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though not my favorite comedian, I really admire his wit.</p>

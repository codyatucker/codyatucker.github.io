## [Homepod Mini](https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/)

Possibly the right device at the right price. I like the overall idea of the original HomePod, but simply could not justify the price. Now, I can consider eventually getting two to pair with an Apple TV. I just hope it sounds good. 

## [iPhone 12](https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/)

I'm so glad we're going back to the squared off sides. The round sides never felt great to me. I think I'll get iPhone 12 Mini, but Apple should have done better with [pricing](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/apple-fibs-about-iphone-12-pricing-to-promote-wireless-carriers/).

There is much rejoicing for the return of [MagSafe](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/magsafe), and for good reason. However, Apple should have tossed the cost savings of [removing AirPods and chargers from the iPhone packaging](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-se-xr-no-earpods-power-adapter/) towards the customer. Instead the prices have gone *up*. The advantages to the environment should be clear, but I feel sorry for all of the retail workers who have to deal with angry customers who have to come back to buy a USB-C charger.

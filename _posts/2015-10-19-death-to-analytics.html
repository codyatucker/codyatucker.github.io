<a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/death-to-analytics/">Death to Analytics</a><br/><p>Benjamin Brooks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are starting a new blog, or have one already, the best thing you can do is turn off all analytics. If you are worried about knowing when your site is “big” then worry no more. Trust me when I tell you: you will <em>know</em> when you site is big, with or without analytics, I promise that you will know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wavering on my use of Google Analytics since the rise of <a href="https://www.ghostery.com" target="_blank">Ghostery</a> and Apple&rsquo;s inclusion of content blockers in iOS 9. Brooks&rsquo; post has definitely pushed way over the side of &ldquo;turn it off&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fire broke out Saturday in one of the world&rsquo;s tallest residential buildings, sending hundreds of people into the streets of Dubai as flames poured out of the luxury apartments.</p>
  
  <p>No one was reported killed and the fire burned for three hours before being brought under control, according to several reports. However, flames engulfed several floors of the iconic Torch skyscraper and debris tumbled to the ground before sunrise. Images of the building in daylight showed smoke and fog still hanging in the air as workers in masks assessed the damage and cleaned up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fire began in the 51st floor of the 81-story building. Impressive effort by response crews, I say.</p>

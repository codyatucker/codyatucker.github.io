<a href="http://osfoora.com/mac/">Osfoora for Mac</a><br/><p>I was on the fence about buying Osfoora for Mac.  I like the iOS version, but for whatever reason it never impressed me enough to stay on my home screen.  I decided to go ahead and buy the Mac version, and I&rsquo;m really glad that I did.</p>
<p>With most apps, especially Twitter apps, I can usually tell within a few minutes if I&rsquo;ll actually keep it around.  Osfoora has a really nice graphical trick up it&rsquo;s sleeve:  Each time I click on a different pane on the left side of the window (say, &ldquo;mentions&rdquo; or &ldquo;messages&rdquo;), the window slides into view from the left, <em>inertially,</em> and bounces into frame.  Clicking on a profile cause a similar action, instead from the right.</p>
<p>I love it when developers take the time to implement these little UI tricks.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://thebbpodcast.com/2012/02/episode-47-bruce/" target="_blank">Ben Brooks</a> was right: the icon is hideous and the name is perplexing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctor who contracted Ebola in West Africa before returning to New York City has been declared free of the virus, hospital officials announced Monday. This news means that 41 days after the first Ebola diagnosis in the United States, there are no known cases of the virus in the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good news, but don&rsquo;t forget that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-29991092" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s still a big problem in Africa</a>.</p>

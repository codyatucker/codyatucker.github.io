<blockquote>
  <p>Toronto announced on Monday that it has signed the 5-foot-5 attacking midfielder/forward to a Designated Player contract, with the 27-year-old joining TFC from defending Italian champions Juventus once the summer transfer opens in July. Per league and club policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>This could be a big deal for the MLS. This isn’t another aging start moving across the pond for one last stop. This is a 27-year-old whose in good form, bringing his skills to the United States.</p>

<p>No offense to the Kaka’s, Lamapard’s and Gerrard&rsquo;s out there.  Those guys are good for the league as well, but MLS has to sign more players like Giovinco if they want to keep expanding the league.</p>

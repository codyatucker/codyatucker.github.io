<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/iphone_5c_5c_event">John Gruber on the new iPhone line:</a><br/><p>Great observation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This move is about establishing the iPhone as a two-sibling family, like how the MacBooks have both the Airs and the Pros. Think of the 5C as the Air, and the 5S as the Pro. Or iMac and Mac Pro. The iPhone is growing up as a product family.</p>

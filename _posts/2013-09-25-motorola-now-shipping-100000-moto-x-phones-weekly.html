<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/09/10/us-google-motorola-idINBRE9891HY20130910">Motorola now shipping 100,000 Moto X phones weekly</a><br/><p>Alexei Oreskovic at Reuters (bold added for emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside said in an interview that the Texas facility, operated by contract manufacturer Flextronics, was capable of producing &ldquo;tens of millions&rdquo; of phones a year but expansion depended on demand.</p>
  
  <p>The factory&rsquo;s current output of 100,000 units a week is only the first phase of a larger plan, he said. <strong>And the factory&rsquo;s output did not necessarily mean all the phones have sold to consumers</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s great that the Google/Motorola experiment is bringing jobs to Texas, but the devices have to <em>sell</em> to make it sustainable.  That remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I would love it if Apple did this with more than just the Mac Pro, but at the rate Apple sells iPhones and iPads, it&rsquo;s perhaps not entirely realistic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the sales pitch for Motorola Mobilityâ€™s (then Google-owned) Moto X smartphone was that it was partly U.S.-made; an assembly plant to put together the Moto X opened in Fort Worth, Texas in May 2013. That plant will close by the end of this year, Motorola confirms to TechCrunch, however, as sales of the smartphone and operational costs have resulted in it being too expensive to continue to operate.</p>

<p>It was worth a try. </p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1nLj2X5" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

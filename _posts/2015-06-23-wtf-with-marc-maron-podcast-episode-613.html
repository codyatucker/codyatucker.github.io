  <p>Marc welcomes the 44th President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to the garage for conversation about college, fitting in, race relations, gun violence, changing the status quo, disappointing your fans, comedians, fatherhood and overcoming fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Extraordinary interview. There are so many little moments and exchanges between Marc and the President that make it so fascinating. Ignore the talking heads that have no perspective, class or relevance. Just go and listen tot his right now. I really can&rsquo;t believe this happened.</p>

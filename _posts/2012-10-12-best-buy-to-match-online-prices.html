<blockquote>
  <p>Best Buy&rsquo;s seemingly contradictory stance underscores the conundrum facing executives at many big-box chains. Aware that they need to adapt aging business models to the realities of mobile- and computer-aided shopping, they don&rsquo;t want to overreact or lose sight of what made them successfulâ€”that is, selection and service.</p>

<p>Noted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure if that will bring me into the store, as the experience of shopping there is at times an utter nightmare.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s good they&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.</p>

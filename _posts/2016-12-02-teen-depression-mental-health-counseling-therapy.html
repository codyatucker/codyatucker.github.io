<blockquote>
  <p>According to background material provided in a university news release, psychological treatments are effective in the short term in about 70 percent of adolescents with depression. But itâ€™s not clear how these patients fare in the long term, the study authors noted.</p>
  
  <p>The study included 465 teens in England who had been diagnosed with depression.</p>
  
  <p>The participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: cognitive behavior therapy (focusing on changing how people think); short-term psychoanalytic therapy (focusing on topics like dreams, memories and the unconscious); or a brief psychosocial intervention (focusing on strategies like encouraging pleasurable activities and combating loneliness).</p>
  
  <p>The researchers found that 70 percent of the teens improved to a significant extent no matter which approach they tried. In those who benefited from treatment, their depression symptoms had declined by 50 percent over the next year.</p>

<p>Apple PR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results were fueled by all-time record revenue from iPhone® and Mac® sales as well as record performance of the App Store℠. iPhone unit sales of 74.5 million also set a new record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly massive iPhone numbers. It added up to a record quarterly revenue of $74.6 billion and record quarterly net profit of $18 billion. That segment has legs, while the Mac keeps growing.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p&gt;Notice they didn’t mention the iPad. That’s because tablet sales <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/01/apples-q1-2015-ridiculously-high-iphone-sales-18-drop-in-ipad-sales/" target="_blank">dropped 18 percent.</a> Alarming.</p>

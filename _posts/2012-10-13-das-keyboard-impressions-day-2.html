<p>Most of the day was spent on the Apple Bluetooth keyboard.  I&rsquo;m weary of getting the Das dirty, as I still have a feeling that it&rsquo;s going to be sent back to Amazon.  It&rsquo;s conterintuitive.  I didn&rsquo;t get back on the Das until 5:30pm.</p>

<p>I called my girlfriend earlier and told her about the new keyboard.  When I switched from using my iPhone speaker to the included headset speaker, she immediately heard the sheer loudness of the Das and forced me to switch to the Apple keyboard.</p>

<p>When I switched, I noticed that the Apple keyboard felt weird.  I was making a lot of mistakes while typing, and I started to feel the extra pressure I needed to press down the key.  Interesting.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m back with the Das, and I&rsquo;m actively trying now to bottom out.  It&rsquo;s definitely less noisy that way, along with being easier on my fingers.</p>

<p>I really miss the Apple function keys, like the volume and brightness keys.  I know there&rsquo;s some way to get them on a second hand keyboard, I just haven&rsquo;t found it.</p>

<p>Something about the Apple keyboard: I have one of the USB extended keyboards sitting closeby.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve been using them so long and they&rsquo;re so easy to use, why not just take one of them to work?  It looks easy to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; to Windows, too.  It&rsquo;ll be easy to type on, quiet and comfortable.  Plus, I&rsquo;ll be using the same keyboard at all times.  Problem solved.(?)</p>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;ll be taking <strong>two</strong> keyboards to work tomorrow.</p>

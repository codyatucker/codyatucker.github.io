<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102104130">Political ads flood Pandora before mid-terms</a><br/><p>Ari Levy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you live in Florida and spend much time on Pandora&rsquo;s streaming service, chances are you&rsquo;re hearing a lot of &ldquo;Rick Scott for Governor&rdquo; commercials. How often depends on how much you like country music.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, with the 2014 mid-term elections just two weeks away, Pandora fans in Arkansas and North Carolina are hearing plenty about their states&rsquo; U.S. Senate races.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just a terrible way to experience music. I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone would use a service that does this.</p>

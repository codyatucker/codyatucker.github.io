<blockquote>
  <p>The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review Oklahoma&rsquo;s controversial method of execution by lethal injection, taking up a case brought by three death row inmates who accuse the state of violating the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
  
  <p>The high court just last week allowed the execution of a convicted killer in Oklahoma over the objection of its four liberal members.</p>

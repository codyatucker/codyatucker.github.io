<a href="https://medium.com/@davepell/don-t-take-a-flying-leap-897f98c62840">Worlds Collide</a><br/><p>David Pell on reports that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/business/media/facebook-may-host-news-sites-content.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Facebook is trying to host content from news sites</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>News organizations should not take that leap of faith. They should not trust Facebook to deliver the news anymore than Facebook should fear their ability to build a competing social network.</p>
  
  <p>Yes, Facebook has built a large and powerful network. But they do not know how to run the news business better than editors, journalists and publishers. And they don’t have the same goals.</p>
  
  <p>Technology has shaken old media to its core. I get that. But they can and must figure out how to deliver content to their readers without ceding the last mile to people who know better about their own business, but who do not know better about what’s best for the news business.</p>

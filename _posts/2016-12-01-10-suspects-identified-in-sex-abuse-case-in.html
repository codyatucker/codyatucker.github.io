<p>Steve Douglas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ten suspects have been identified by one of the 17 police forces investigating a sex-abuse scandal in youth soccer that is engulfing the British game.</p>

  <p>Greater Manchester Police said on Thursday it was following up reports from 35 people, and its inquiry was growing &ldquo;on a daily basis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Since former professional players went public over the last two weeks about the ordeals they went through as youngsters, around 350 people across the country have reported cases of child sexual abuse in soccer clubs, the National Police Chiefs&rsquo; Council said.</p>

  <p>A hotline set up by a children&rsquo;s charity in response to sex-abuse claims has taken more than 860 calls in its first week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bad week for the football.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wednesday night&rsquo;s blasts, so large that they were seen by satellites in space, sent shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away in the port city of 15 million people. Internet videos showed fireballs shooting into the sky and the U.S. Geological Survey registered the blasts as seismic events.</p>
  
  <p>Vast areas of the port - the 10th largest in the world - were devastated, crumpled shipping containers were thrown around like match sticks, hundreds of new cars were torched and port buildings left as burnt-out shells, Reuters witnesses said.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;I was sleeping when our windows and doors suddenly shook as we heard explosions outside. I first thought it was an earthquake,&rdquo; Guan Xiang, who lives 7 km (4 miles) away from the explosion site, told Reuters by telephone.</p>

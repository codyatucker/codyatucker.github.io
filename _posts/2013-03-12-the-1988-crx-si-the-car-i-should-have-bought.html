<blockquote>
  <p>The CRX was a pure sports car. What it might have lacked in straight-line power, it more than made up for in the curves. The little car handled like it was on rails and, because John and I sometimes swapped keys, I soon found that I could carry a great deal of speed through the corners. It was a fun, slick little car and I enjoyed every chance I got to slide behind its wheel.</p>

<p>I had a 91 CRX Si for a couple of years or so.  It was both incredible and infuriating.  It&rsquo;s the car I credit for teaching me how to drive.  From the moment I sat in it&rsquo;s tiny little frame, I never looked at cars the same way again.</p>

<p>But after a couple of years, it became extremely difficult to live with.  At over 220,000 miles, the engine was in the twilight of its life.  The ride was extremely unforgiving, and the interior squeaked and rattled at intolerable levels.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to let it go, and just months later it was &ldquo;t-boned&rdquo; and totaled.  I hope the driver made it out of the crash safely, and as much as I loved the car, I&rsquo;m really glad I wasn&rsquo;t in that crash.</p>

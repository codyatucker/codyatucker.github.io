<a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/20/apple-munster-iphone-numbers/">By the numbers: Apple's U.S. launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C</a><br/><p>Philip Elmer-Dewitt quotes data from Piper Jaffray&rsquo;s Gene Munster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>90% of iPhone 5S/5C buyers were upgrading from another version of the iPhone compared to 83% for the iPhone 5 launch and 73% for the iPhone 4S. We note that given the relative maturity of the smartphone market in the US, it is not surprising to see that a majority of iPhone 5S/5C buyers were current iPhone users. We believe that the high level of iPhone users upgrading to the new 5S or 5C demonstrates continued high loyalty levels among iPhone users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, depending on how you look at it, Apple is either retaining a huge share of its customers by making great products with useful new features, or they&rsquo;re brainwashing them by reskinning year old tech or year old looks, then overcharging people for it.</p>

<p>I argue the former.</p>

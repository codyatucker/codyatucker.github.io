<blockquote>
  <p>So my host calls in the IT guy. He walked in, looked at my set up and said it:</p>
  
  <p>“Oh. You’re Mac”</p>
  
  <p>Those were his exact words. He delivered them dripping with judgment. He didn’t say I was using a Mac. He said I was Mac.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my previous job, the IT department dealt with Macs, iPhones and iPads. Still, there was always a sense of cynicism about them.</p>

<p>At the same time, some of the IT workers enjoyed using their cheaper Nooks and Kindle Fire&rsquo;s, all while looking forward to using the original Microsoft Surface.</p>

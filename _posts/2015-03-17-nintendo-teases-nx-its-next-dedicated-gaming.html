<blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo is being unusually candid about its product roadmap, with news that it will work on mobile titles with partner DeNA, and a reveal of its next console project – or at least the fact that it’s working on one. Nintendo’s Chief Executive Satoru Iwata told a press conference today that its next-generation console will be called NX, and is currently under development with a “brand new concept.”</p>
  
  <p>What Nintendo didn’t do was give us any indication of what NX is, or when it might arrive. Iwata did say that we’ll learn more about it next year, meaning it could make an initial appearance at E3 2016 or at its own dedicated unveiling. The news might be a candid admission that Wii U hasn’t been the home console Nintendo had hoped for, which might lead to a fast-forward refresh in the form of the NX, vs. an update cycle more in time with its competitors Sony and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;brand new concept&rdquo; quote is concerning. It could be VR, but I would be happy with a moderately powerful machine, with a nice controller that welcomes third party developers.</p>

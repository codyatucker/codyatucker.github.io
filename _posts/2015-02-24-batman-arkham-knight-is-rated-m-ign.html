<blockquote>
  <p>The studio&rsquo;s previous Batman games, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, both earned &ldquo;T for Teen&rdquo; ratings. Sefton Hill, founder of Rocksteady and game director on Arkham Knight, said the M rating surprised him because the team didn&rsquo;t specifically aim for it.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;From our point of view, we never wrote it or made it with a rating in mind. We never did that in the previous two games&hellip; We just felt that this is the story that we really wanted to tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that a studio handling the Batman pedigree would focus solely on the story without being persuaded by industry pressure. There is clearly a boatload of money to be made by making it &ldquo;E&rdquo; or &ldquo;T&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to play this game.</p>

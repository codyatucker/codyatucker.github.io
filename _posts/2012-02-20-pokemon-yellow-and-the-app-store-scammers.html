<a href="http://www.imore.com/2012/02/20/app-store-scam-app-invasion/">Pokemon Yellow and the App Store Scammers</a><br/><p>Thankfully, the Pokemon Yellow scam app <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/20/2812849/psa-fake-pokemon-yellow-app-store-iphone" target="_blank">has been pulled</a>.  Meanwhile, Rene Ritchie posted a great piece on the growing problem of iOS scamming.  I like this idea:</p>

Keep those extra, extra curated. Scam apps in search results are more difficult to tackle problem, but scam apps in the Top 100, especially in games, is probably manageable. Get a team that knows the biggest classics and the hottest new games, and when something that looks like a scam app shows up in the Top 100, contact the developer and ask for proof of ownership and license, and contact the owner of the original app and inform them of a potential violation of their IP.</p>

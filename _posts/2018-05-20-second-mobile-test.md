So here's a second mobile test, this time using [Drafts](http://getdrafts.com) on iOS. Drafts may be a simpler solution altogether than Editorial. I like Editorial, but I don't think I need such a complex app for my use case. 

>Also, I should test out blockquotes with a [hyperlink](http://www.codytucker.net) to see if the link shows up in red or black.

>I also need to makes sure I add an extra '>' in blockquotes so that there is no break on the left border.

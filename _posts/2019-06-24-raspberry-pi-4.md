This is just delightful. Not only is it the long-awaited update we all wanted, but the company boldly calls it "Your new desktop computer":

>The speed and performance of the new Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up from earlier models. For the first time, we've built a complete desktop experience. Whether you're editing documents, browsing the web with a bunch of tabs open, juggling spreadsheets or drafting a presentation, you'll find the experience smooth and very recognisable — but on a smaller, more energy-efficient and much more cost-effective machine.

Dual-display support, up to 4GB of ram for $55, with the 1GB RAM model starting at the classic $35 price point. 

I wonder if they should have limited their options in favor of a singular model with, say, 2GB of RAM. The iPhone XR reportedly runs [3GB of RAM](https://www.cultofmac.com/576127/iphone-xs-max-xr-benchmark-geekbench-ram/), though they're obviously two wildly different devices. 

There's no point being speculative here. I just love that the Raspberry Pi exists.

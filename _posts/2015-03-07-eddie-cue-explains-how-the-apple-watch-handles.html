<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/7/8166401/how-apple-pay-works-with-apple-watch-explained-by-eddy-cue">Eddie Cue explains how the Apple Watch handles Apple Pay</a><br/><p>Dante D'Orazio at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to CNET, the Apple executive explained the feature thusly: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to authenticate on the phone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your watch has to be unlocked, and your phone can unlock your watch.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;If I took my watch off and gave it to you, it would know and no longer work. If I wanted to pay right now, I could pay with the watch and not have to take the phone out of my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>The Apple Watch&rsquo;s health sensors know when the device is strapped to your wrist and when it&rsquo;s off your person. According to Cue, Apple is taking advantage of that data to simplify the payment experience. You will, however, need to confirm a payment by tapping the button on the side of the Apple Watch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It just works.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s strange that Apple would have a high-level exec detailing how the service works outside of their own event, <em>before</em> the device launch.</p>

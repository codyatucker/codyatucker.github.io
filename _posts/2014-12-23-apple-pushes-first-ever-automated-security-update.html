<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc has pushed out its first-ever automated security update to Macintosh computers to help defend against newly identified bugs that security researchers have warned could enable hackers to gain remote control of machines.</p>
  
  <p>The company pushed out the software on Monday to fix critical security vulnerabilities in a component of its OS X operating system called the network time protocol, or NTP, according to Apple spokesman Bill Evans.NTP is used for synchronizing clocks on computer systems.</p>

<p>I saw the notification pop up on my iMac earlier this evening. I tried to click on it but it disappeared quickly. Not knowing what exactly it was, it gave me a strange feeling.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&rsquo;m fine with Apple doing this if it fixes a critical security issue. However, I think Apple should accompany the release with a blog post (or better yet, something in the Mac App Store&rsquo;s &ldquo;Updates&rdquo; screen) that details what the update is, including what it does and does not do.</p>

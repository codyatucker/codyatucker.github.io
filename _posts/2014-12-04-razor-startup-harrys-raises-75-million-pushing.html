<blockquote>
  <p>In January, Harry’s, an online seller of razors with fancy handles that was just 10 months old, bought a German factory with $100 million of a $122 million investment round. That was rare.</p>
  
  <p>Today, it is announcing that it has raised another $75 million, in large part to expand its manufacturing capacity and buy new equipment for a new production hall and new machinery to help it test and create new products. This is rare, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a recent convert to Harry&rsquo;s, and so far I&rsquo;m very pleased with the service. Quality good, conveniently delivered, all while being cheaper than the well-established competition.</p>

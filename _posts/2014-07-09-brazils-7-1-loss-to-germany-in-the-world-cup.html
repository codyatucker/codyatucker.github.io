<p>Ian Macintosh sums up the historic defeat well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When this World Cup began, Luiz Felipe Scolari&rsquo;s objective was to give the Brazilian supporters a performance that would make them forget forever what happened in 1950 in the Maracana. Well &hellip; mission accomplished. The Maracanazo, the shocking 2-1 defeat to Uruguay that cost Brazil the World Cup they assumed they&rsquo;d already won, is now only the second worst night in their history.</p>
  
  <p>That result was so stunningly awful that poets compared it to Hiroshima. Pele&rsquo;s father burst into tears in front of the television at full time. His young son, just 10 years old at the time, according to legend, comforted him and promised he would grow up and win the World Cup himself. Many of the players responsible for that failure were pariahs for decades afterward.</p>
  
  <p>What will become of these players?</p>
</blockquote>

<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/podcasts-worries/">Ben Brooks on podcasts</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling the same way lately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of a podcast should not be that the podcasters enjoy the show, but that the listeners enjoy the show. I think thatâ€™s lost on most podcast hosts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make a podcast.  It&rsquo;s hard to make a <em>good</em> one.</p>

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-24/apple-sells-5-million-iphone-5-in-record-debut-weekend.html">iPhone 5 hits 5 million sold...so far</a><br/><p>Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The number is lower than what people had expected,” said Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, in an interview. He had estimated debut weekend sales of 6 million to 6.5 million units. “This seems to be driven more by availability than demand.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their headline speaks of how the iPhone 5 &ldquo;misses estimates,&rdquo; but:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early orders in Apple’s online store topped 2 million units in one day, Apple said on Sept. 17. The company said in the statement today that “while the majority of pre-orders have been shipped to customers, many are scheduled to be shipped in October.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows how many preorders are left to ship, but it&rsquo;s possible this number could push the 6-7 million mark.  Not quite 8, but they should have made that distinction a bit more clearly.</p>

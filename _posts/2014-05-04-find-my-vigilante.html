<blockquote>
  <p>With smartphone theft rampant, apps like Find My iPhone offer a new option for those desperate to recover their devices, allowing victims like Ms. Maguire to act when the police will not. But the emergence of this kind of do-it-yourself justice — an unintended result of the proliferation of GPS tracking apps — has stirred worries among law enforcement officials that people are putting themselves in danger, taking disproportionate risks for the sake of an easily replaced item.</p>

<p>This is stupid. <strong>Don&rsquo;t do this</strong>.  It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Find My iPhone,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Track my iPhone to a thief&rsquo;s home only to get shot in the face.&rdquo;</p>

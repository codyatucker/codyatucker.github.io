<a href="https://brooksreview.net/2014/07/on-the-surface-pro-3/">On the Surface Pro 3</a><br/><p>Ben Brooks is speaking for himself here, but I think it really speaks for <em>any</em> Mac owner who would dare ponder buying a Surface Pro 3 for a job bound to Windows software:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPad is an outstanding device, as is my MacBook Pro. So then the only use I would have for a Surface is as a secondary device to remove the need for VMware running Windows.</p>
  
  <p>But then we are talking about $799 for a base model machine and I still have to buy the type cover. So really $928 all in. All that for a device I may not even like.</p>
  
  <p>For less money I can buy an 11″ MacBook Air and install Windows on it (I already own Windows) in a native Bootcamp partition. Even if it turns out I don’t use Windows on the MacBook Air, I still have a MacBook Air. And I know the MacBook Air is outstanding with excellent battery life and something I will use with or without Windows on it.</p>

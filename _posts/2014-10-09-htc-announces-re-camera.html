<blockquote>
  <p>It’s waterproof and pocketable, so it could work well in a party or sports situations, although you’d have to assume that action sports types would use a GoPro and party people on the go would simply use their phones. But it can also be worn in a shirt pocket, as a kind of lifelogger. A future software update will allow the Re to livestream video to Youtube. Its small size and discrete shape also raises questions about using the Re for secret recording for nefarious purposes. While the Re is recording video, there’s a hardwired LED on the front that will light up.</p>

<p>It costs $200, which might be a bit steep. Give it a year and I bet it drops down to $100. Till then, early adopters will have to find clear use case for it.</p>

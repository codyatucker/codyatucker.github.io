<blockquote>
  <p>According to a Financial Times report (subscription required), Apple is set to announce its acquisition of headphone manufacturer Beats Electronics for $3.2 billion &ldquo;as early as next week.&rdquo; The company, currently the American leader in headphone sales, was founded in 2008 by Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine and hip-hop legend Dr. Dre, and it expanded this year with a subscription-based online music service, called Beats Music, that currently competes with Apple&rsquo;s own iTunes Radio offering.</p>

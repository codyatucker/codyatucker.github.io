<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/01/18/kuo-ipad-pro-stylus/">Rumors of iPad pro with stylus gain steam</a><br/><p>MacRumors reporting on a scoop by Ming-Chi Kuo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is back with another report outlining his belief that Apple will launch a stylus as an optional accessory for the company&rsquo;s rumored 12.9-inch &ldquo;iPad Pro&rdquo;. With the new iPad&rsquo;s larger screen, it will likely prove popular with enterprise and creative users who tend to have more need for a stylus and Kuo believes Apple will fill that need with an in-house solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be especially interesting to see precisely how Apple uses a stylus in promotional videos. I highly doubt you&rsquo;ll see it being used for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; inputs. If it&rsquo;s used for anything other than hyper-specific tasks, I&rsquo;ll be very surprised.</p>

<a href="http://www.motorsport.com/hillclimb/news/witnessing-death-at-pikes-peak-a-first-person-account-of-bobby-goodin-s-final-moments/">Witnessing death at Pikes Peak</a><br/><p>On Sunday, <a href="http://ift.tt/VmZ1Me" target="_blank">Bobby Goodin died in a motorcycle crash</a> moments after crossing the finish line at Pike&rsquo;s Peak. </p>

<p><a href="http://ift.tt/1x2tkWd" target="_blank">Witness accounts of the crash</a> are horrifying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we arrived at the summit, we spoke to a couple of photographers and riders who had seen the accident. It seems Goodin crossed the line and was still going at a decent clip when he raised his hand to celebrate making it to the top. He lost the front end on the unpaved section at the top and the bike veered right, launching Goodin over the edge, flipping him end-over-end into a patch of boulders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trevor Andrusko was at the summit working as a photographer, but now he&rsquo;s an unfortunate witness to a tragedy that he says could have been handled better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That&rsquo;s when I notice something else out of the ordinary. Chaos. Everyone up here is supposed to be up here. There are no fans; only media, officials, and competitors. But, people are shouting over the howling wind, arms are flailing, and panic is spreading. I begin to realize that there is no plan in place for something of this nature. I scan again. The only vehicles on the summit are a handful of private media cars and the two media shuttles. No ambulance, no safety truck, and no helicopter. Shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goodin was 54-years-old.</p>

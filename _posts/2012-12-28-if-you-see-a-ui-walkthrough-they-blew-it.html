</a><br/><p>Max Rudberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are novelty apps for people lusting for the very latest in app design. Besides using a more flat UI style, which is a topic for a different discussion, all apps contain non-standard interactions. This means users don’t know how to use them beforehand, and all start with a multi-step UI walkthrough before you get to use the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rudberg’s referring to apps like Clear, and after a <a href="https://twitter.com/phillryu/status/284428304377864193" target="_blank">twitter discussion with Clear’s developer</a>, he clarified parts of his statements.</p>

<p>But I think he’s right. I’ve owned Clear for iOS and Mac for a long time now, and every time I try to use it, I have to first <em>remember</em> how to use it.  I’ve come to an appreciation of the design and the hard work that’s gone into it, but I’ve never put the app to any good use.</p>

<p>I have a hard time watching movies or TV shows in which the director uses fancy camera angles and editing techniques that ultimately get in the way of the story.</p>

<p>Similarly, I have a hard time using an app when the developer makes UI decisions that ultimately get in the way of using the app.</p>

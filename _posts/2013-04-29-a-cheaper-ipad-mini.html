<p>Here come <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/04/28/apple-considering-lower-priced-ipad-mini-at-199-249" target="_blank">rumors of a cheaper iPad mini</a>, but this problem appears to have been solved years ago.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s entirely plausible to me that Apple would simply follow the model set by the iPhone, where the latest model is the flagship, and the previous model or two hang around at lower price points.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “Wirelurker” malware was flagged by security firm Palo Alto Networks, and is notable because it is one of the first pieces of malicious code that can infect iPhones that have not been jailbroken, or modified so that they can use apps not approved by Apple. But Wirelurker still requires users to download an unauthorized OS X app for their Mac computers—in particular one of several hundred that are available on a Chinese app store called Maiyadi—after which the malware is transferred to an iPhone or iPad via a USB cable.</p>

<p>Not to self: <strong>Don&rsquo;t download shady software from shady websites.</strong></p>

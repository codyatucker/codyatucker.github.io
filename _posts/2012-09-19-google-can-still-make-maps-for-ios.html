<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/iphone-5-review/">Google can still make Maps for iOS</a><br/><p>In MG Siegler&rsquo;s glowing iPhone 5 review, he brings up a great point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect Apple will see quite a bit of backlash about this change above all others. But I also expect they’ll iterate their maps pretty quickly. And who knows, maybe we’ll see a Google Maps app pop-up in the App Store, just as we did with a YouTube app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really considered this too much, but it&rsquo;s quite plausible.  Could we one day end up with two <em>free</em>, high quality iOS mapping apps with built-in turn by turn navigation?</p>

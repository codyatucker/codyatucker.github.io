<blockquote>
  <p>The gunfire erupted at about 12:15 p.m. outside of a Twin Peaks Restaurant, where the members of the motorcycle clubs had gathered. The fight spilled into the parking lot, initially involving just fists and feet, but escalating quickly to chains, knives, clubs and firearms. Waco police officers were already at the scene when the confrontation unfolded because they had anticipated problems as hundreds of bikers from at least five groups gathered at the shopping plaza.</p>
  
  <p>“When they approached the scene, there were multiple people on the scene firing weapons at each other,” Sgt. Patrick Swanton, a Waco Police Department spokesman, said at a news conference, referring to the officers in the area of the restaurant. “They then turned on our officers. Our officers returned gunfire, wounding and possibly killing several.”</p>

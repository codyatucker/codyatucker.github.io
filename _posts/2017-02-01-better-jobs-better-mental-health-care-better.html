<blockquote>
  <p>The superintendent said what he would like to see first from Trump is “better financial support to these impoverished neighborhoods — better jobs, better mental health care, better education.”</p>

  <p>Johnson also asked Trump for more federal prosecutions of gun offenses and more federal law-enforcement agents.</p>

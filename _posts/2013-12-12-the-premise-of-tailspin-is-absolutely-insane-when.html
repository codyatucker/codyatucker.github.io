<blockquote>
  <p>There was Baloo, the cartoon bear from The Jungle Book, flying a twin-engine float plane against air pirates. Why air pirates? Because in the world of TailSpin, the whole world was an air- and sea-based, and everyone flew. Of course there were gonna be scimitar-wielding air pirates.</p>

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/ipad_mini">Gruber's iPad Mini Review</a><br/><p>John Gruber:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The combined weight of an 11-inch Air and a full-size iPad &frac34; is about 3.8 pounds. The combined weight of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina display and an iPad Mini is about 4.2 pounds. That seems like a better kit for my needs: a far more powerful Mac for work, and a far more comfortable iPad for reading, at less than half a pound of additional weight to carry around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love my iMac, but at times, I feel it would really nice to have an 11-inch Air that I could carry to work for a few specific tasks.</p>

<p>Perhaps next year there will be an Mini with a retina display.  That would obviate any trepidation of a switch from and iMac/iPad 3rd gen setup to an 11-inch Air/iPad Mini setup.</p>

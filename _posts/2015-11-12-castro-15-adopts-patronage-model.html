<p>Via Suprtop&rsquo;s blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you like Castro, please consider becoming a patron by contributing $1/month. You will support the work of a small indie app studio in a way that the standard App Store model never can. Yesterday, Supertop needed an endless stream of thousands of new customers to sustain our business. From today, we can be successful with a far smaller number of much happier customers. We can offer better support. We can add new features more often, instead of holding them back for splashy major releases. In other words, we can do the things that indies do best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This move mirrors <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing" target="_blank">Marco Arment&rsquo;s</a> approach with Overcast. If it&rsquo;s true that a patronage model will allow developers to do more with fewer &ldquo;customers&rdquo;, then best of luck to them. I hope it works out.</p>

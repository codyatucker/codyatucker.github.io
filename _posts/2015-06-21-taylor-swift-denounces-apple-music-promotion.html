<a href="http://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/122071902085/to-apple-love-taylor">Taylor Swift denounces Apple Music promotion</a><br/><p>Taylor Swift:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.</p>
  
  <p>I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial periodâ€¦ even if it is free for the fans trying it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the streaming services go about paying artists, and Swift&rsquo;s post does little to help.</p>

<p>That said, it seems like the goal here is to get as many people as possible to try out Apple Music for 3 months. Free of charge. That means at the end of the three months, there&rsquo;s a mass of people who are just a click away from keeping or canceling a potentially highly lucrative service for Apple and the artists involved. I&rsquo;m assuming many people will keep the service.</p>

<p>Swift&rsquo;s motives may be sound, but they fail to consider the long haul.</p>

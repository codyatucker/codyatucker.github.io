<blockquote>
  <p>Sean Harrington’s plea deal, which was finalized on Tuesday, means that he receives a 180-day suspended sentence, three years of felony probation, and according to local media accounts “must also speak at a community violence solutions class to tell everyone what he did.” Harrington resigned from the CHP last year after the charges were filed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The argument of non-violent offenders applies. What&rsquo;s important is that the offender surely can&rsquo;t be trusted to serve as a police officer again.</p>

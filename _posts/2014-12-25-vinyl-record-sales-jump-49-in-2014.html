<a href="http://cir.ca/s/mHg">Vinyl record sales jump 49% in 2014</a><br/><p>Circa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A total of 7.9 million vinyl records were sold through early December, according to Nielsen. That represents year-over-year growth of 49%. Jack White’s “Lazaretto” was the best-selling record of the year, with 75,700 units sold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lazaretto&rdquo; is a fantastic album. Also, I should get my record player fixed.</p>

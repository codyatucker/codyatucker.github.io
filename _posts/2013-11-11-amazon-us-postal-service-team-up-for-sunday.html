<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon has announced a partnership with the US Postal Service that will see the retailer deliver packages on Sundays from now on. The program is rolling out first to Prime members in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, but the company plans to extend it to cities including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, and Phoenix in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to see who could come out of this the bigger winner. It could be a big boost for the Postal Service, but the success would look <em>really</em> good for Amazon if it&rsquo;s credited for saving a dying federal service.</p>

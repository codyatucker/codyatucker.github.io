<blockquote>
  <p>A towering, 50-meter thick wall may sound like the fevered dream of isolationists bent on border control, but it just might be the solution to the midwest&rsquo;s tornado problems. University of Drextel physicist Rongjia Tao reckons that a trio of 1,000-foot high, 165-foot &ldquo;great walls&rdquo; could mitigate the worst natural weather of Tornado Alley &ndash; a loosely defined area that spans several states with high tornado risk. Tao compared Tornado Alley to a geographically similar area in China and concluded that the midwest suffered from more tornados primarily because it doesn&rsquo;t have east-west mountain ranges to weaken or block the weather patterns that form them. Now he&rsquo;s proposing that we build some.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The project would surely cost billions and would probably look terrible-if built for that one purpose alone. But if it&rsquo;s proven effective, it could save countless lives. </p>

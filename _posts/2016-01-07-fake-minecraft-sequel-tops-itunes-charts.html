<blockquote>
  <p>Although this $7 app advertises itself as a sequel to Mojang’s ubiquitous brick-building game, it’s actually blatant fraud. The game itself has nothing to do with Minecraft, as Eurogamer discovered early this morning—it’s actually a swiping game where you have to fight zombies using Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. Until it crashes your phone.</p>
  
  <p>None of that stopped Minecraft: Pocket Edition 2 from skyrocketing to #4 on iTunes’ paid app chart, as redditors on r/games discovered late last night. Although the game is no longer on top of the charts, it remains on iTunes, where you can find the same scammer selling other games too.</p>

<p>What a total embarrassment for the App Store.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under a new policy that&rsquo;s already gone live, users will still be able to follow, and see new updates from public account holders, even if the follower&rsquo;s been blocked. Under the previous method, those same users wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to follow the account, or see the profile picture associated with it. In effect, Twitter&rsquo;s blocking tool is now more of a mute button, as Forbes notes â€” which means blocked users can&rsquo;t really tell they&rsquo;ve been blocked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use Tweetbot to mute people and I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I blocked anyone.</p>

<p>In fact, the block/spam actions always seemed to be entangled somehow, so maybe this helps ease that confusion.</p>

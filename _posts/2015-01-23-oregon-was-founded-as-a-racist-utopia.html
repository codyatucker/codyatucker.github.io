<blockquote>
  <p>When Oregon was granted statehood in 1859, it was the only state in the Union admitted with a constitution that forbade black people from living, working, or owning property there. It was illegal for black people even to move to the state until 1926. Oregon&rsquo;s founding is part of the forgotten history of racism in the American west.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And let’s pause to emphasize the importance of this step as part of the initial console setup, rather than background functionality to be sussed out later on — this fundamentally transforms how the vast majority of soon-to-be Wii U owners will interact with their Wii U. The console instantly becomes the de facto media unit, interacting with your cable box, DVR, and various digital streaming offerings, as well as directly controlling your television.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great selling point. Provided the controller works well, the Wii U could have a huge impact on a living room set up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how you gain new customers&hellip;and keep them.</p>

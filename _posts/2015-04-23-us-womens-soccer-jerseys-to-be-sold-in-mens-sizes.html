<blockquote>
  <p>The women’s World Cup is rapidly approaching, and as countries gear up for the tournament, Nike has unveiled the home kits that the US women’s national team will wear on the field. The mostly black-and-white jerseys have sparked some outrage for not brandishing the colors of the US flag, but another of the jersey’s traits is sure to find more support.</p>
  
  <p>For the first time ever, the jerseys will be available in men’s sizes. As Bloomberg reported, Nike has had it in mind for some time to fix the very obvious double-standard of selling the men’s team jerseys in women’s and youth sizes but not offering guys a shot to wear the women’s team jerseys.</p>

<p>The kits are beautiful. I love the black and white design choice, it&rsquo;s simple while being a bit bold at the same time. I hope I can buy one of these.</p>

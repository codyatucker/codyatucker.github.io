<blockquote>
  <p>China&rsquo;s ban on video game consoles was temporarily lifted today, making them available to consumers living in the region after 14 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating.  And given <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-4-sales-reach-4-2-million-outselling-xbox-one-by-1-2-million-units-in-2013/1100-6416987/" target="_blank">a strong rollout by both Microsoft and Sony</a>, it looks to me that console gaming is still alive and well.</p>

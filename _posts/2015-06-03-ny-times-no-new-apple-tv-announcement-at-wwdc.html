<blockquote>
  <p>A major setback for the Apple TV involves content. Apple plans to offer its Apple TV, iPhone and iPad customers a bundle of channels that is smaller and cheaper than the large catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription, according to people briefed on the service, who discussed the incomplete plans on the condition of anonymity. Media executives have been coy about the existence of the coming Apple TV service — the chief executive of CBS said last week that his network would “probably” sign a deal with Apple. Separately, Showtime announced on Wednesday a new Internet streaming service that would debut on Apple devices in July for a monthly fee of $10.99.</p>
  
  <p>But in the background, content providers have also whispered that they are far from reaching deals with Apple to offer an Internet-based TV service, largely because they have not come to an agreement on price, rights and technology issues, according to people briefed on the discussions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, we&rsquo;ll have &ldquo;settle&rdquo; for a Watch App tool kit, plus the yearly updates to iOS and OS X. I&rsquo;m still jazzed about it.</p>

<a href="http://inessential.com/2015/10/17/when_the_weapon_was_pointed_at_me">When the Weapon Was Pointed at Me</a><br/><p>Meanwhile, some powerful stuff from Brent Simmons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In retrospect there are a couple other things to learn. One is that nobody but me has any memory of this at all.</p>
  
  <p>Another is that I wasted that six months being hurt by this. I was certainly depressed during that time, and I didn’t need to be, because it wasn’t worth it.</p>
  
  <p>And I’m still hurt by it, so many years later, and I should let it go, but there it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simmons&rsquo; piece comes in the fallout of <a href="http://samanthabielefeld.com/journal/big-money-is-coming" target="_blank">Samantha Bielfeld&rsquo;s</a> caution to female writers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m new to the idea of writing for an audience, and certainly inexperienced when it comes to receiving hundreds of hurtful emails in response. A word of wisdom to female writers out there; if you publish something negative about Marco, you will receive threats of rape, and physical harm.</p>

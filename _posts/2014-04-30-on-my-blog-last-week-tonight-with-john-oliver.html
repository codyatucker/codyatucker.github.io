<a href="http://www.codytucker.net/index/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-episode-1">On my blog: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Episode 1</a><br/><p>HBO was (apparently) kind enough to allow the first episode of John Oliver&rsquo;s new show, &ldquo;Last Week Tonight,&rdquo; to stream on YouTube.</p>

<p>That means, you get to watch an all-new HBO show <em>for free.</em> </p>

<p>I watched it under my current, excruciatingly expensive cable plan, and it was worth every penny.  Thus, I would argue that you owe HBO money for letting you watch it for free.</p>

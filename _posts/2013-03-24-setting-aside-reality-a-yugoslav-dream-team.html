<blockquote>
  <p>After World War II, the majority of the Slavic people of the Balkans, who had long been under the rule of various empires and exchanged like pawns in a giant game of chess, came together to form one independent state: Yugoslavia. The state was composed of six republics and two autonomous regions and, for the most part, ethnic and religious differences were smoothed out and hidden under the rug of nationalism. Yugoslavia survived, in one form or another, for nearly sixty years. But after the death of long-time ruler Josip Broz Tito, the union began to disintegrate.</p>

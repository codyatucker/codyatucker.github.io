Robert S. Mueller III:

> We made every decision in Stoneâ€™s case, as in all our cases, based solely on the facts and the law and in accordance with the rule of law. The women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.

I quite enjoy the directness of his prose.

<a href="http://one37.net/28/9/2012/tim-cook-apologizes-for-maps-history-repeats-itself">"History repeats itself"</a><br/><p>Matt Alexander with a great take on <a href="http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/" target="_blank">Tim Cook&rsquo;s Maps apology</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&rsquo;ve been worked, in other words, into a veritable frenzy of anger and entitlement over a business decision that we know — emphatically — was going to have to occur sooner rather than later. And yet, just as the media necessitated a press conference following the laughable &ldquo;antenna-gate&rdquo; scandal, we once again find ourselves reading through an apology from a chief executive whose sole aim is to create good user experiences for his customers.</p>

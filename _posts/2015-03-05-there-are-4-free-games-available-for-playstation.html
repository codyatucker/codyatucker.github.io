<p>Earlier today, in the aftermath of another winter storm, I thought about hopping on PSN and buying a new game. But, with a new car payment on the way, I decided to save my money.</p>

<p>Later, I decided to check out the Playstation Store on my PS4 - just in case there were any deals around.</p>

<p>Turns out, there are actually <em>four</em> games available for free to PS+ subscribers: OlliOlli 2, Oddworld: Abe&rsquo;s Oddysee (New &lsquo;n&rsquo; Tasty edition), Valiant Hearts - The Great War, and Counterspy. As some folks at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/2y02le/just_wanted_to_throw_it_out_there_we_got_75_worth/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have pointed out, this is awesome.</p>

<p>You can argue as much as you want about the drawbacks of buying software games, or about how you in some way pay for the games with the PS+ subscription fee. The value of getting $75 worth of games for $0 extra can not be debated.</p>

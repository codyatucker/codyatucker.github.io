<blockquote>
  <p>Judge James L. Robart, 69, was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004, following a distinguished 30-year career in private practice that included his selection to the American College of Trial Lawyers, an honor bestowed on less than 1 percent of lawyers.</p>
  
  <p>The judge made the most high-profile ruling of his tenure Friday when he temporarily invalidated Trump’s ban on travel to the U.S. from seven primarily Muslim nations. Washington state sued to block the order - with support from Minnesota and major corporations including Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia - arguing that it’s unconstitutional and would harm its residents, and Robart held that the state was likely correct.</p>
  
  <p>The Department of Justice filed a notice Saturday night to appeal Robart’s decision, requesting that implementation of the controversial executive order resume immediately.</p>

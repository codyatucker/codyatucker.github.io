<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131017/twitter-plans-to-revamp-its-private-messaging-product/">Twitter considers separate app for direct messages</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>But Twitterâ€™s new vision for direct messages will go further. It has kicked around the idea of launching a standalone direct-messaging application separate from the Twitter app, according to three people familiar with the matter. It is unclear, however, what form the final revamp of direct messages will take.</p>

<p>With Facebook, I like having a standalone messaging app because I no longer have to look at Facebook just to communicate with a few friends.</p>

<p>But I like looking at Twitter, I just hate how it buried DM&rsquo;s so deeply inside its native app.  Twitter is so basic, it can stand to put DM&rsquo;s further up front in the app without needing an external solution.</p>

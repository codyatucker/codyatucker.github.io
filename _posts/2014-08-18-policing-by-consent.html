<blockquote>
  <p>The UK Parliament passed the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Act_1829" target="_blank">Metropolitan Police Act in 1829</a>. The act was introduced by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel, who undertook a study of crime and policing, which resulted in his belief that the keys to building an effective police force were to 1) make it professional (most prior policing had been volunteer in nature); 2) organize as a civilian force, not as a paramilitary force; and 3) make the police accountable to the public. The Metropolitan Police, whose officers were referred to as &ldquo;bobbies&rdquo; after Peel, was extremely successful and became the model for the modern urban police force, both in the UK and around the world, including in the United States.</p>

  <li><p>To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.</p></li>
  </ol></blockquote>

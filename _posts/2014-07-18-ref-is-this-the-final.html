He certainly looked like he was out of it, and the ref appears to confirm those suspicious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He told Gazzetta dello Sport: &ldquo;Shortly after he&rsquo;d been struck by Garay, Kramer came to me, asking &lsquo;ref, is this the final?&rsquo;</p>
  
  <p>&quot;I thought he was joking so I asked him to repeat the question, and he said: 'I need to know if this is really the final.&rsquo;</p>
  
  <p>&quot;After I said 'yes&rsquo;, he was a bit stunned and said: 'Thanks, that&rsquo;s important to know.&rsquo;</p>
  
  <p>&quot;I informed [Bastian] Schweinsteiger and they replaced Kramer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reddit has shut down the subreddit /r/CoonTown, along with other racist forums, including /r/WatchN****rsDie, /r/bestofcoontown, /r/koontown, /r/CoonTownMods, and /r/CoonTownMeta.</p>
  
  <p>In an announcement on Reddit, CEO Steve Huffman, writing as /u/spez, announced a change in policy for the site that led to the removal of the subreddits. “We are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people will greet the news by saying “finally,” which is sad. This should have been settled long ago.</p>

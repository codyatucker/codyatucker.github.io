<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking to Australian auto news site Motoring.com.au, CEO Matthias Mueller said the appearance – inside and out – has missed the mark, and changes are coming for the redesign. &ldquo;There have been some small mistakes and we will do it better,&rdquo; Mueller said. &ldquo;For example the design could be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I always thought the Panamera looked great. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now we’re hearing that Apple is changing its course. The PCalc app and widget will remain in the App Store, and all calculator-type widgets will be allowed as well, an Apple spokesperson has confirmed to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, the app&rsquo;s creator has to go and find out for himself:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just had a phone call from Apple - decision has been reversed, no changes required to PCalc’s widget. Thanks to everybody for their support!</p>— James Thomson (@jamesthomson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/527869788228714496" target="_blank">October 30, 2014</a></blockquote>

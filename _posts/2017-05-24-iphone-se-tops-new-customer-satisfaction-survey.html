<p>I adore my iPhone SE. I upgraded from a 6 Plus, and despite the massive change is screen size, I quickly adjusted to the SE thanks to it&rsquo;s perfect form factor. Despite lacking some high-level features, it&rsquo;s simply remarkable how powerful and capable this phone is at the price point. It&rsquo;s easily my favorite iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple may be on it&rsquo;s way to creating it&rsquo;s next all-time greatest phone, but it&rsquo;s going to have to do serious work if it wants to beat the SE.</p>

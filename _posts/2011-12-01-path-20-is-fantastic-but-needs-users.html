<p>I installed the first version of Path nearly immediately after it was released.  It lingered on my iPhone for several months before I eventually deleted it.  The UI and overall experience was great, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any friends that were using the app.  With version 2.0, the app is exponentially better than I could have ever dreamed of, but the same problem remains:  no one seems to be using it.  </p>
<p>Hopefully the flurry of tech writers gushing over the newest version will attract the mainstream attention that is sorely needed.  It has a chance at becoming the benchmark for all mobile apps going forward.  </p>

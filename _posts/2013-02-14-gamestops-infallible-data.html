<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/gamestop-60-of-customers-wont-buy-console-that-doesnt-play-used-games/">Gamestop's infallible data</a><br/><p>Kyle Orland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it was 60 percent of customers who said they wouldn&rsquo;t buy a new console [if it blocks used games],&rdquo; GameStop CFO Rob Lloyd told the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference (as reported by VG247). &ldquo;Consumers want the ability to play preowned games, they want portability in their games; they want to play physical games. And to not have those things would be a substantial reason for them not to purchase a new console.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I think</em> if customers had the option to buy <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/25/apple-q4-2012-earnings-35-97-billion-in-revenue-8-67-eps/" target="_blank">significantly cheaper software that&rsquo;s super easy to access</a>, they would no longer care about grubby used games and everyone would win.</p>

<p><strong>I think</strong>.</p>

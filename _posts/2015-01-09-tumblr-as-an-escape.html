<a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/09/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media">Tumblr as an escape</a><br/><p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social networks are designed around who you are and who you know. They’re for 24/7 contact with your family, classmates, friends, bosses, coworkers, ex-classmates, ex-bosses, ex-coworkers, ex-friends, ex-family, and exes, in a medium that doesn’t leave much room for humanity, filtering, subtlety, and nuance. Some people love it; I only see the irrelevance, drama, and baggage that comes with it, and being politically impossible to un-“friend” many of them.</p>
  
  <p>As a teenager, I escaped from these real-life people, problems, and social statuses to the internet — the last thing I wanted was to be surrounded by them there, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here.</p>

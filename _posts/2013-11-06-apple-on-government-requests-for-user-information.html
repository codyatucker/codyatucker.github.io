<a href="http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/131105reportongovernmentinforequests2.pdf">Apple on government requests for user information</a><br/><p>The fourth paragraph is a swift dagger to it’s biggest competitor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps most important, our business does not depend on collecting personal data. We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers. We protect personal conversations by providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime. We do not store location data, Maps searches, or Siri requests in any identifiable form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s paragraphs like that which bring a smile to the face of <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/11/lolz/" target="_blank">Ben Brooks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best part about the report, and the reason why I am linking to it, is the masterful job Apple does at shaming people/entities/corporations/governments in a public document without outrightly coming out to shame them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The irony, though, is that by making this announcement, Apple joins the very same companies it is shaming, all calling for more government transparency.</p>

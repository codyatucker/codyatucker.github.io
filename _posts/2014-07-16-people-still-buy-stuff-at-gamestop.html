<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/14/digital-distribution-isnt-killing-retailer-gamestop-its-only-making-it-stronger/">People still buy stuff at GameStop </a><br/><p>&hellip;like, lots and lots of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2013, the company generated $724.4 million in digital sales. That includes its Kongregate mobile gaming site, PC digital downloads, and in-store digital sales. For the first quarter of its fiscal 2014, GameStop noted that its digital revenue grew 9.5 percent year-over-year thanks in large part to currency cards for PS4 and Xbox One. GameStop is the biggest game-specific retailer in the world.</p>

<p>Crazy, right? Venture Beat breaks down how the brick and mortar store makes bank on digital sales:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GameStop has made a ton of effort to make sure it provides a satisfactory experience for customers looking to purchase digital goods. For games on Sony platforms, the process is simple. GameStop will sell people codes for specific DLC. Players can then take that home and enter it into their system, and the content automatically starts downloading. On Xbox systems, people can say they want certain DLC, and GameStop will sell them an Xbox Live gift card with money to get that expansion.</p>

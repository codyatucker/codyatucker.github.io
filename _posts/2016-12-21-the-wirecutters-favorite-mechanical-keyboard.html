<p>I’ve heard lots of good things about the top pick, but I’m still tempted to go with a Matias option. My Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate has served me well, but I’d like some built in volume controls for the Mac.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Turns out, the new <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/p/prime13-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank">Das Keyboard Prime 13</a> includes audio controls and Mac compatibility. Looks great.</p>

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OmMalik/~3/aYJBI1JFvAI/">Chrome rises from 1.5% to 3% of iOS use since June 2012 launch</a><br/><p>Kevin C. Tofel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think there’s an additional explanation to account for the overall trend: Google has steadily been “linking” its mobile apps for iOS together. Case in point: In May, Google updated Gmail for iOS so that links in mail could be automatically opened inside Chrome, not Safari. Google quickly followed up with a new programming method for third-party iOS developers to do the same, saying “With Chrome’s OpenInChromeController class with x-callback, users can open a web page in Chrome and then return to your app with just one tap.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of apps have added &ldquo;open in Chrome&rdquo; support over the past year or so. People seem to like it.  But as much as I like it, haven&rsquo;t found any advantage to using Chrome on iOS.</p>

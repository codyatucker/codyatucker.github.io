<blockquote>
  <p>It isn’t the only major pizza chain in America with a gluten-free pizza option—Domino’s put gluten-free crusts on its menu two years ago—but whereas Domino’s couldn’t promise that pizzas made with those crusts would be safe from cross-contamination, Pizza Hut said it’s keeping the ingredients for its gluten-free pizzas totally separate from all others in each restaurant where the pizzas are offered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While competitors were way ahead of them, perhaps they waited until they could do it right.</p>

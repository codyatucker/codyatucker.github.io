<a href="http://one37.net/blog/16/9/2013/made-for-ios-7">"Experience governed by the apps"</a><br/><p>Excellent point my Matt Alexander:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Penning lengthy treatises about the mechanics of iOS 7 design, whilst exclusively using iOS 6-designed third party apps for testing, is reductive and short-sighted.  iOS 7, just like its predecessors, is not an experience dictated by or constituted of the mechanics of the Weather or Mail apps. It is an experience governed by the apps the user chooses to install from the App Store.</p>

The results are staggering.</p>

<p>As someone who works in news, I&rsquo;m fascinated by the 2-story control room: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The control room was first built offsite, too, in a Los Angeles warehouse. Drake and his crew examined it thoroughly and tailored it with such detail that monitors were moved inches at a time during the drafting phase in California. Then it was all replicated to the same exact measurements months later and 5,000 miles away.</p>
  
  <p>The entire compound is powered by three giant generators that Drake calls “the beasts.” They are each twice the size of a meat freezer, and they hum quietly outside the control room in a space formerly reserved for a fish market. There’s also a fourth generator that powers the studio’s lights, a satellite truck connected to the IBC in case of emergency and bundles of cables winding down back corridors and around scaffolding, all just steps from the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ESPN has done a truly excellent job with this. It&rsquo;s a <em>temporary</em> set which looks infinitely better than it&rsquo;s <a href="http://ift.tt/1d5WSeT" target="_blank">new monstrosity in Bristol.</a></p>

<p>After 2014, Fox owns the rights to cover the next two World Cups. I hate its coverage of the Champions League, thus I am not looking forward to its World Cup coverage.</p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1oaMYvc" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

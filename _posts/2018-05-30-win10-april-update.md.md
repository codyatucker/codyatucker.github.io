Peter Bright: 

> By way of comparison, the previous update, version 1709 (“Fall Creators Update”) took about two months to reach 50 percent penetration, and the one before that, version 1703 (“Creators Update”) took around three months to reach the same level.

> The faster rollout suggests greater confidence within Microsoft that the update is relatively problem-free. Version 1803 hasn’t been immune to issues—it was blocked temporarily from installation on systems with certain SSDs—but the speed of the rollout suggests that it has avoided any major issues.

A great sign for Microsoft. Updating a Windows 10 machine is a far better experience than Windows 7. It’s also clear that users trust it to not make massively unsettling changes to their daily workflow, and the brisk adoption rate _should_ aid security of a large swath of PC’s around the world.

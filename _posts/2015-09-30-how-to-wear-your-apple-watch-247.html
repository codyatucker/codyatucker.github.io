<blockquote>
  <p>The TL/DR is to charge your Apple Watch in the morning while you get ready for your day (take a shower, get dressed, etc) and then again in the evening while you get ready for bed (brush teeth, put on pajamas, etc). Then put your Apple Watch in Airplane Mode while you sleep.</p>

<p>Brilliant. David Sparks is <a href="http://www.feedwrangler.net" target="_blank">the best</a>.</p>

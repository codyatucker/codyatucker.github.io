<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/02/iceland-temple-norse-gods-1000-years">Iceland to build first temple to Norse gods since Viking age</a><br/><p>The Guardian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Icelanders will soon be able to publicly worship at a shrine to Thor, Odin and Frigg with construction starting this month on the island’s first major temple to the Norse gods since the Viking age.</p>
  
  <p>Worship of the gods in Scandinavia gave way to Christianity around 1,000 years ago but a modern version of Norse paganism has been gaining popularity in Iceland.</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a horse with eight feet,” said Hilmar Orn Hilmarsson, high priest of Ásatrúarfélagið, an association that promotes faith in the Norse gods.</p>
  
  <p>“We see the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of nature and human psychology.”</p>
  
  <p>Membership in Asatruarfelagid has tripled in Iceland in the last decade to 2,400 members last year, out of a total population of 330,000, data from Statistics Iceland showed.</p>

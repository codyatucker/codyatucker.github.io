<a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-introduces-4k-21-5-inch-imac-force-touch-magic-trackpad-and-refreshed-5k-27-inch-imac/">Apple adds 4K 21.5-inch iMac, updates keyboard, trackpad and mouse</a><br/><p>Graham Spencer at MacStories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting at $1,499, this new 21.5-inch iMac has a screen resolution of 4096 x 2304 and the base model comes with a 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, a 1TB hard drive, 8GB of memory, and an Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200 graphics card. You can also customize the new iMac – upgrading the processor up to a 3.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, add up to 16GB of memory, and up to 512GB of Flash Storage (or 2TB Fusion Drive).</p>

<p>In Jason Snell&rsquo;s review for <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2991920/hardware/imac-with-4k-retina-display-review-a-high-resolution-desktop-mac-for-the-masses.html" target="_blank">Macworld</a>, he argues that you should go with the Fusion Drive over the base 5400rpm drive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base storage configuration of the 4K iMac is a 1TB, 5400rpm hard drive. It’s been a few years since I regularly used a Mac with a spinning disk as its primary hard drive, and man, did it feel slow. Starting up was slow. Launching apps was slow. Everything&hellip; just&hellip; took&hellip; longer. It’s disconcerting to take a brand-new, top-of-its-line Mac out of the box and be disappointed by how sluggish it feels, but that’s what I experienced, and it’s pretty much down to that slow hard drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple also announced the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2. <a href="http://www.apple.com/magic-accessories/" target="_blank">The trio of devices</a> all come with a built in lithium-ion battery that charge via Apple&rsquo;s standard lightning cable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most intrigued by the Magic Trackpad 2, as it would replace the original unit that I&rsquo;ve been using since 2011. It also comes with the Force Touch technology that&rsquo;s built in to many of Apple&rsquo;s notebooks, which adds a whole new depth of interaction to OS X. The Magic Keyboard looks fantastic, but it doesn&rsquo;t feature Apple&rsquo;s new key switches that comes with the Macbook.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My initial set of reviews put the iPhone 6 on top, and the 6 Plus as a close second; further testing suggests they might actually be better characterized as reversed in order – the 6 Plus ends up being a better mobile computing device for my everyday use habits, even if it isn’t necessarily as mobile as its other new companion. Sure, it doesn’t fit quite as nicely in the skinny jeans I generally favor, but it still fits, and it’s a much better device for typing out a post on the go, if I end up needing to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel myself leaning towards the 6 Plus as my next phone, but as Etherington mentions later on, this weeks presumed iPad announcement will be very interesting in light of the 6 Plus, and there&rsquo;s no way I buy anything until Apple plays its hand.</p>

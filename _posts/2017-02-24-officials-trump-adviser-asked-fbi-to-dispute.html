<blockquote>
  <p>WASHINGTON (AP) â€” White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asked top FBI officials to dispute media reports that Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign advisers were frequently in touch with Russian intelligence agents during the election, according to three White House officials who confirmed the unusual contact with law enforcement involved in a pending investigation.</p>

  <p>The officials said that Priebus&rsquo; Feb. 15 request to FBI Director James Comey and deputy director Andrew McCabe came as the White House sought to discredit a New York Times report about contacts between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump&rsquo;s 2016 campaign team.</p>

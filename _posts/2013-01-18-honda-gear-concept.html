<p>Honda quietly introduced a new concept car called the Gear.  And though it&rsquo;s billed as a micro-sized city car, I hope Honda sees this as the basic formula for their next generation Civic and Fit.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Honda after owning a 1991 CRX Si.  The car was amazing simple, with a clean, yet striking design. Current Honda&rsquo;s are missing that.  The Fit is a fantastic car, but still too busy. The Civic looks nice, there&rsquo;s just <em>a lot</em> going on with the exterior design, and the interior is far to busy for my tastes.</p>

<p>The Gear mirrors Volkwagen&rsquo;s recent success with the gorgeous GTI.  Clean and simple designs that hearken back to a long history of excellent vehicles.  Current Honda&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t do that, while the Gear&rsquo;s design is direct descendent of <a href="http://www.cardomain.com/ride/3897295/1983-honda-civic/" target="_blank">a 1983 Civic</a>.</p>

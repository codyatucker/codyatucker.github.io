<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/52Tiger/~3/WLKqzSFtP4k/">What if "watch" is the wrong word?</a><br/><p>Dave Caolo makes an excellent point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine that Apple isn’t specifically designing a watch, but the next step in its portable devices. Something that does much of what iOS devices do today, only in a novel way, and is smaller than current devices. Small enough to be, say, attached to one’s wrist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another case where perspective makes all the difference.</p>

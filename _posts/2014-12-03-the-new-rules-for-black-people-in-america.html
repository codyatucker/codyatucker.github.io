<blockquote>
  <p>Black people are supposed to be like Martin Luther King. But only the paper version preserved in mythology. Not the version who was angry and ready to fight, not the version who understood why riots are necessary. Not the version that had a PhD and was wearing a suit with his pants pulled all the way up and got shot in the face anyway.</p>

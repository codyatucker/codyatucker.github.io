<blockquote>
  <p>With the iPad Air, Apple has created the world’s thinest and lightest full size tablet. And by adding their 64-bit A7 processor they have made it extremely powerful as well. After using the iPad Air for the past week I’m convinced that it is the perfect personal computer for the masses.</p>

<p>The local Best Buy had one on display over the weekend.  Even with its massive security crap strapped to it, I could not believe how thin and light it was.</p>

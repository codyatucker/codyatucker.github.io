  <p>That said, this move smacks of desperation. Because Microsoft’s shifted from a strategy of “if you want to use our apps, you have to pay for a subscription” to “okay, you can use most of the common features for free, but we hope you’ll upgrade for fancier features.” Clearly, Redmond’s hoping that first, free taste will be enough to get you hooked. Then again, if Microsoft’s subscription strategy was succeeding, it wouldn’t be making this change.</p>

<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/19/photo-of-ipad-3-logic-board-with-a5x-system-on-a-chip/">MacRumors' iPad 3 Logic Board Photos</a><br/><p>Who knows if this will turn out to be true, but it at least seems plausible.  It makes sense that Apple would stagger their major update schedule in order to &ldquo;regroup&rdquo; after each major revision.  One major question that remains regards the software:  Will there be any major design changes to iOS?  I&rsquo;m guessing not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping the &ldquo;A5X&rdquo; will make it&rsquo;s way to the Apple TV.</p>

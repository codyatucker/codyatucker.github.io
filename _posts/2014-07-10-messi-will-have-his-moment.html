<p>The world&rsquo;s best footballer (sorry, Ronaldo) will get his moment at soccer&rsquo;s biggest stage this Sunday.</p>

<p>This, apparently, is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2014/07/09/argentinas-win-over-the-netherlands-is-a-victory-for-world-cup-partners-and-american-viewers/" target="_blank">good for business</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That Europe vs. South America final is instantly one of the most anticipated matches in recent memory, and Wednesday’s outcome is, according to tournament viewership figures, also a win for FIFA’s corporate partners and millions of American viewers. The reason for that is simple: Thus far in the tournament Argentina has, more often than not, been a bigger television draw than the Netherlands among soccer fans in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s also good for history. Lionel Messi will finally have his chance to bring home the sport&rsquo;s greatest prize for his home country, just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona" target="_blank">Diego Maradona</a> did back in 1986&hellip;against West Germany.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another reason why Sunday&rsquo;s match is so historic:</p>

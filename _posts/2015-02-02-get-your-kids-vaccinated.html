<blockquote>
  <p>In the face of a growing measles outbreak, President Obama is urging parents to heed modern science and vaccinate their children.</p>
  
  <p>“There is every reason to get vaccinated — there aren’t reasons to not,” Obama said in an interview with NBC News. Excerpts from the interview were aired Sunday night and Monday morning.</p>
  
  <p>“I just want people to know the facts and science and the information,” the president said. “And the fact is that a major success of our civilization is our ability to prevent disease that in the past have devastated folks. And measles is preventable.”</p>

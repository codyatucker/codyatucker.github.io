<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/03/playstation-20th-birthday-retro-ps4/?ncid=rss_truncated">Playstation celebrates its 20th birthday with a retro-themed, limited-edition PS4</a><br/><p>The console is a thing of beauty, but I already have the boring black one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what if you already own a PS4? Or don&rsquo;t fancy your chances of snagging one of the limited run? You can still get your dose of nostalgia, as Sony&rsquo;s also released a PSone theme for it&rsquo;s current console &ndash; complete with vintage start-up sound &ndash; you just need to download the latest firmware update.</p>

<p>Done!</p>

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/ZZMLlEWFfsA/sms-nonprofit-human-trafficking-text-crisis">Saving The World, One Text At A Time</a><br/><p>Salena Larson on <a href="http://www.polarisproject.org/" target="_blank">Polaris Project</a>, which started using text messages to save women and teens from human trafficking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was Marissaâ€™s 18th birthday when she was rescued from an abusive pimp by a team of undercover police officers. A text message saved her life.</p>
  
  <p>Marissa sent a text to the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking in the U.S., and in just two hours the nonprofit and law enforcement officers coordinated a way to remove her from the dangerous situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Larson, Polaris Project is just one of many non-profits joining up with tech companies to do some truly incredible work.  Great read.</p>

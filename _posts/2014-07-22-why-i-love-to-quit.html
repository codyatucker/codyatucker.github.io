<a href="http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2014/07/21/love-quit/">"Why I Love to Quit"</a><br/><p>Paul Jarvis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I’ve reached the conclusion that 9 times out of 10, choosing to quit is more important than toughing it out.</p>
  
  <p>Quitting is a direct action that leads to a more thoughtful and efficient way of spending our limited resources. There’s value in choice, in quitting, and in accepting that neither is failure. Quitting is really just opening up to new, possibly unknown, opportunities. Yes, it could lead to everything going to shit, but if it’s already gone to shit, why not quit?</p>
  
  <p>And if you think through your post-quitting steps beforehand, your world won’t necessarily come crashing down instantaneously.</p>

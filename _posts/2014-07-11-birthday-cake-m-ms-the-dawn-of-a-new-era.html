<blockquote>
  <p>I tried Birthday Cake M&amp;M’s for the first time tonight, and they are far stranger than I had expected. I had assumed that, like their Peanut Butter or – crucially – their Pretzel forbears, each candy piece would contain a morsel of actual cake. The truth is that Birthday Cake M&amp;M’s are concocted to taste like fake processed chocolate cake – an artificial artificial flavor.</p>

<p>The cake is a lie.</p>

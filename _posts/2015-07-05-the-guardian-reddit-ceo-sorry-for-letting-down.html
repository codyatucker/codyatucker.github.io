<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/04/reddit-subforums-ellen-pao-explains">The Guardian: Reddit CEO sorry for 'letting down' users after popular subforums shut down</a><br/><p>Jana Kasperkevic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chief executive of the social media site Reddit, Ellen Pao, has apologized for “letting down” users after the company fired a well-liked employee.</p>
  
  <p>Until Thursday, Victoria Taylor managed the site’s popular Ask Me Anything subreddit. Her dismissal as director of talent sparked a “Reddit revolt”, in which about 300 subreddits (or discussion areas) on topics including gaming, science, history, and cinema were shut down by their moderators.</p>
  
  <p>While Reddit would not comment on the specifics of Taylor’s dismissal, the company said it was working on providing its moderators with a better infrastructure and support network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a rough week over there.</p>

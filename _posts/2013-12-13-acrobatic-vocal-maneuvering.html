<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/sports/soccer/ray-hudson-mixes-soccer-calls-with-awe.html?_r=0">Acrobatic Vocal Maneuvering</a><br/><p>Over the past two years, I&rsquo;ve developed a love for soccer.  It started with a friend suggesting I play FIFA World Cup 2010 for Xbox.</p>

<p>Later, I would tune in to soccer games on <a href="http://www.watchespn.com" target="_blank">WatchESPN</a> Xbox as a way to help me sleep.  Somehow, the steady roar of the crowd and commentators helped me relax.</p>

<p>Soon after, I realized just how <em>big</em> international football is.  I starting learning about all the top-flight players across the BPL, Liga BBVA, Series A, and Ligue 1.  WatchESPN just wasn&rsquo;t enough anymore, so I caved in and bought cable again.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until I found <a href="http://www.beinsport.tv/" target="_blank">BEIN Sport</a>, featuring the incredible commentary of Ray Hudson.  Now, Richard Sandomir New York Times helps us get to know the reluctant broadcaster whose enthusiasm for the game is unmatched by anyone in sports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Hudson’s world, soccer is a wild, multilayered legend with brave lads, paleface assassins, emasculations and cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. Superstars sprinkle stardust. Men backpedal in high heels. Defenders disappear like the children in “The Blair Witch Project” and forwards peel away from pursuers like tissue off a toilet roll. He once said that Lionel Messi, the Barcelona star who has long been a Hudson favorite, plays so beautifully “he could make an onion cry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that one man in a small room in Florida can project the excitement and passion of people on the other side of the world; simply by sound of his voice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe your PC doesn&rsquo;t meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; the policy reads. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within 14 days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s more, games that fall outside that 14 day/two play-hour range can still be submitted for a refund request, and Valve says it will &ldquo;take a look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great move by Valve. There have been plenty of times where I&rsquo;ve purchased a physical game and returned it after it didn&rsquo;t meet expectations. It&rsquo;s good to see digital sellers following suit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This morning, my words were everywhere, chopped up and twisted by sensational opportunists to fuel the tired “Apple is doomed!” narrative with my name on them. (Or Tumblr’s name, which was even worse.) Business Insider started the party, as usual, but it spread like wildfire from there. Huffington Post. Wall Street Journal. CNN. Heise. Even a televised CNBC discussion segment.</p>
  
  <p>All of them using my name, and a few of my words, to create drama, fan the flames, and get some views.</p>
  
  <p>And there were a lot of views. The small fraction that came back to my site still pushed it past the pageview totals for any posts I wrote in 2014. You might think this is a dream come true for a blogger, but it’s horrible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits he could have worded his criticism differently, but that doesn&rsquo;t excuse several large media companies from latching on to it and using it to fit their narrative.</p>

<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/05/11Apple-Announces-New-Environmental-Initiatives-in-China.html">Apple Announces New Environmental Initiatives in China</a><br/><p>The PR Machine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple® today announced an expansion of its renewable energy and environmental protection initiatives in China, including a new multi-year project with World Wildlife Fund to significantly increase responsibly managed forests across China. The new forestland program aims to protect as much as 1 million acres of responsibly managed working forests which provide fiber for pulp, paper and wood products.</p>
  
  <p>Apple’s goal is to achieve a net-zero impact on the world’s supply of sustainable virgin fiber and power all its operations worldwide on 100 percent renewable energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its similar to strategies they&rsquo;ve implemented at home. I dig it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sarkeesian took to her Twitter account to confirm that cancellation, stating “police wouldn’t take steps to prevent concealed firearms at the event” and “requested pat downs or metal detectors after mass shooting threat, but because of Utah’s open carry laws, police wouldn’t do firearm searches.” As Sarkeesian noted earlier, this speaking event would have been the third in which she had been anonymously threatened with violence in an attempt to prevent her from speaking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing to live in a country where adolescent gun rights ideologies can prevail over the basic freedom of speech and expression.</p>

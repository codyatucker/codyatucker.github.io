<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/users/Renato%20Goncalves">Luis Suárez FC Barcelona Contract Includes 'Anti-Bite' Clause</a><br/><p>Renato Goncalves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to multiple reports with knowledge of the situation, the Uruguay striker&rsquo;s contract with Barça will indeed have an &ldquo;anti-bite clause&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a conduct-based addition to his agreement, that states very clearly that another bite, or any conduct issue for that matter, will have harsh consequences for Luisito.</p>
  
  <p>The clause gives Barça the right to suspend Suárez themselves if another incident like the one involving Italy&rsquo;s Giorgio Chiellini happens again. Luisito can also be fined €5 million, among other penalties.</p>

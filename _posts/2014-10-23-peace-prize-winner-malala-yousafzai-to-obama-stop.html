<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;My message was very simple,&rdquo; Malala, who is now 17, said Tuesday at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia, speaking of her recent meeting with the president. &ldquo;I said instead of sending guns, send books. Instead of sending weapons, send teachers.&rdquo; Asked by the host, Ronan Farrow of MSNBC, how Obama reacted, she said simply that his response was &ldquo;pretty political.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad that more people aren&rsquo;t sending this message. It applies to every single corner of civilization.</p>

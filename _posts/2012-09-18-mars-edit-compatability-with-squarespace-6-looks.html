<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever the future holds for Squarespace, itâ€™s safe to assume that 3rd party editors will not be supported by Squarespace 6 in the near future. In the mean time, users who already have Squarespace 5 sites should keep their site as it is if they want to continue using MarsEdit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also frustrating is the lack of functionality that Squarespace provides for <strong>their own iOS apps</strong>.  Neither have been updated to retina graphics, plus posting for Squarespace 6 hasn&rsquo;t been updated from version 5.</p>

<p>Thus, your reading this on my old tumblr site.  It works with MarsEdit and Tumblita.  I can live with that.</p>

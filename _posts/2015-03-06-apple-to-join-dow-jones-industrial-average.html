<blockquote>
  <p>Apple ended trading Feb. 23 at $133 per share, giving the company a market cap of $774.7 billion. The company is now worth more than twice as much as the next closest publicly traded U.S. company, Exxon Mobil, which has a market cap of $377 billion. Apple first reached a $700 billion market cap during midday trading in Nov. 2014.</p>

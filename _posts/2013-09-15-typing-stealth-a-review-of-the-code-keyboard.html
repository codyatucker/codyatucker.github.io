<blockquote>
  <p>The CODE keyboard uses Cherry MX Clear mechanical switches, which are stiff compared to the more common Cherry MX Blues and Browns. Because of this, the keyboard somewhat mimics the feel of a rubber dome keyboard like the ever-popular Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still want this keyboard, but the use of the MX Clears are worrying. I love the MX Browns in my Das Quiet Keyboard, but I wish they would make a 10-keyless version for home use.</p>

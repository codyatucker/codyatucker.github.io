<a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/06/27/apple-stops-development-of-aperture/">Apple drops Aperture, iPhoto in favor of new Photos app</a><br/><p>Jim Dalrymple quotes a statement from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With the introduction of the new Photos app and iCloud Photo Library, enabling you to safely store all of your photos in iCloud and access them from anywhere, there will be no new development of Aperture,” said Apple in a statement provided to The Loop. “When Photos for OS X ships next year, users will be able to migrate their existing Aperture libraries to Photos for OS.”</p>
  
  <p>The new Photos app will also replace iPhoto, giving users a more seamless experience on Apple devices. The app will allow you to edit and search your entire photos library in the cloud on any of your Apple devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, it&rsquo;s the same story for <a href="http://ift.tt/1nMLJAE" target="_blank">both on Mac and iOS</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;and for good reason.  iPhoto is just too heavy and confusing on all of its devices. It&rsquo;s pretty useful once you get the hang of it, but surely <em>everyone</em> benefits from having the most important features consolidated into Photos.</p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1jW91Se" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The baseball establishment pronounced Alderson and La Russa as spotless. They are role models. Their integrity is unquestioned. Canseco reports that six to eight A’s were juicing by the time he was traded to Texas. But the stain did not wear off onto the men who assembled and managed them. La Russa later conceded some of his A’s were juicing, but he cut Canseco’s number in half and exempted McGwire. La Russa’s reputation remains untarnished. McGwire and Bonds are considered cheaters and their records are questioned. But nobody suggests that La Russa should not be credited as manager of the 1989 world champs.</p>

<p>A truly excellent piece of writing (not to mention the incredible site design).</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of just how badly we all were duped throughout the 80s and 90s, the blood isn&rsquo;t just on the hands of the players.</p>

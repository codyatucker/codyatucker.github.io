<blockquote><p>Together, the U.S. and China account for more than a third of global greenhouse emissions, and today, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-obama-xi-climate-change-20141111-story.html" target="_blank">they’ve agreed to significant cuts</a>. The deal has negotiators hoping it will inspire similar commitments from other countries.</p>
<p>The details: President Obama agreed that the U.S. would cut net greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% by 2025, doubling its current pace of carbon reduction. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a stepped-up time frame for carbon reduction and for increasing the country’s use of nuclear, wind and solar energy.</p>

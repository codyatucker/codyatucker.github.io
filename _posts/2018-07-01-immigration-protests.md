Dakin Andone, CNN:

>According to organizers, protesters have three demands:
>
- They want separated migrant families to be reunited immediately.
- They want the government to end family detentions.
- And they want the Trump administration to end its zero tolerance policy.

One can hope these demonstrations will continue, leading to massive voter turnout in November.

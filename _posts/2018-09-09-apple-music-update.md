Federico Viticci:

>While the old artist page design of Apple Music mixed albums, singles, EPs, live albums, and more under the same 'Albums' section, the new Apple Music features separate sections for different types of music releases. The new sections include singles and EPs, live albums, essential albums recommended by Apple Music editors, compilations, and appearances by an artist on other albums. As pictured above, Apple Music now also highlights an artist's latest or upcoming release at the top of the page.

A much welcome improvement here. Hopefully the same changes will come to the Library as well.

<a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/13/04/22/dashboard.app.allows.for.kinect.motion.controls.voice.recognition/">Pizza Hut for Xbox Live</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>A new Microsoft Xbox Live app, scheduled to launch on April 23, will allow users of the gaming and media service to order Pizza Hut products directly from the Xbox 360 console. The new app gives customers access to the restaurant&rsquo;s entire menu, and features full Kinect integration in addition to voice recognition, or regular game controller use.</p>

<p>Right now I have an Ethernet cable plugged into my Xbox, which runs to absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>This announcement will not change that.</p>

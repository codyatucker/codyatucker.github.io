<blockquote>
  <p>Tuesday&rsquo;s rupture released as much as 2,500 barrels (105,000 gallons) of crude oil, five times more than the initial estimate, according to a &ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo; presented by pipeline owner Plains All American Pipeline. It said up to a fifth of the spill had reached the ocean.</p>
  
  <p>The 24-inch-wide (61-cm-wide) pipeline, which runs underground parallel to a coastal highway west of Santa Barbara, inexplicably burst on Tuesday morning, belching crude oil down a canyon, under a culvert and onto Refugio State Beach before it flowed into the Pacific, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.</p>

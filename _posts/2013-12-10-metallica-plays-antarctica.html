<p>Miriam Coleman at Rolling Stone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to meet international Antarctic protocol to preserve the fragile local environment, Metallica played the whole show with no amplification. The sound was instead transmitted to the audience through headphones. The show was also live-streamed and filmed for later release.</p>

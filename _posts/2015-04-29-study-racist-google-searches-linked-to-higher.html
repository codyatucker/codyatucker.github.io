<a href="http://cir.ca/s/nDLB">Study: Racist Google searches linked to higher mortality rate of black people in that area</a><br/><p>Circa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No region west of Texas falls into the &ldquo;much more than average&rdquo; category, the map shows. Concentrated areas of racist searches also appear in the Gulf Coast, Michigan&rsquo;s Upper Peninsula, and much of Ohio. The study took into account variations on the n-word and approached the research with understanding that not all searches were racist in nature.</p>

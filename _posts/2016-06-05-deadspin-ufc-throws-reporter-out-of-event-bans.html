<p>Tim Marchman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine the NBA having Adrian Wojnarowski escorted out of a game in the third quarter and banning him for life for having reported a trade rumor. Ridiculous as it seems, a scenario exactly like this just happened at a UFC show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a truly shameful move by the UFC. If officials have a spine, they’ll reverse their decision immediately.</p>

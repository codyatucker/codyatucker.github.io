<a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/09/07/all-about-the-games">It’s All About The Games</a><br/><p>Marco Arment makes it simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Game-system successes are made by specific, exclusive, new, mass-market, category-defining hit games. That’s it.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Like “killer apps” in computer parlance, game systems become hits from specific games that are so good that people see or play them somewhere (often at a friend’s house) and want them so badly that they buy the entire system.</p>
</blockquote>

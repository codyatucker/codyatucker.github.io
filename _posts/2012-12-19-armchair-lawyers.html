<a href="http://one37.net/blog/19/12/2012/armchair-lawyers-surprisingly-proven-wrong">Armchair lawyers</a><br/><p>A great observation from Matt Alexander:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although I appreciate that there is, indeed, further to go in the matter, Honan&rsquo;s update rings false to me. Simply put, Honan was swept up in the hype of a situation he didn&rsquo;t fully comprehend. Of course, he wasn&rsquo;t alone, but I think it serves as a glimmering endorsement of shutting up, getting out of the way, and reserving judgment until you have all the facts in hand.</p>

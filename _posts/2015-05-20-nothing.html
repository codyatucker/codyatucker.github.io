<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ve been in most of the major media in the world talking about this game industry hate group, including the Washington Post, CNN, the BBC and MSNBC. I went on Nightline to talk about them. I have an employee at my company whose entire job it is to research and catalogue these threats for law enforcement.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, terrifyingly, nothing has been done.</p>
  
  <p>On my hard drive, I have the name of a man that sent me death threats so explicit and shocking, they made a Law &amp; Order episode about them. I have identifying information about this person, and sent them to the FBI almost 9 months ago. Right next to them sits 5 other cases, meticulously documented for law enforcement.</p>
  
  <p>Terrifyingly, nothing has been done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple sells 64GB iPhones and 128GB iPads. If you own one or both of these, and fill them up with photos and documents, you literally cannot buy enough storage to back up even one of them in full — iCloud’s largest tier of storage maxes out at 50GB.</p>

<p>Within the past 24 hours or so, I&rsquo;ve run out of free storage in iOS and Dropbox.  It sucks.</p>

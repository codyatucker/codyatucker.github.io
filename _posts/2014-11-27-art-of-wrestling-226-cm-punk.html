<a href="http://overca.st/8AS1tmAQ">Art Of Wrestling 226: CM Punk</a><br/><p>Even if you&rsquo;re not a wrestling fan, this is a must listen.</p>

<p>CM Punk breaks his silence over why he left the WWE earlier this year, and the details are earth shattering. This will definitely blow your mind if your a wrestling fan, but you&rsquo;ll certainly be taken aback even if you&rsquo;ve never watched two men lock up in the squared circle.</p>

<p>Punk, it appears, leaves no stone unturned, and while this is all his perspective, there&rsquo;s currently no reason to believe it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

<p>I would argue that this could very well be a landmark moment for the podcasting medium, given the potential fallout inside the WWE.</p>

<p>Also: Kudos for Punk doing it all for free on a podcast. He easily could have made millions off this story, be it in a book or a high-profile interview.</p>

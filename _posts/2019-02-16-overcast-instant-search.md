Marco Arment:

>I’m not satisfied if the podcast you’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data.

If you ship a feature with the word "instant" in the title, it better deliver. In this case, the new Instant Search feature is *instant*. It's actually sort of fun to just search for things, just to see how fast the results arrive.

<a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter's home site actually shows you something</a><br/><p>Back in the day, going to Twitter.com would net you a simple splash page with a prompt to sign in or sign up. Now, you can actually look through tweets in select categories.</p>

<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s gone from showing you &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; to &ldquo;something&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s probably an improvement.</p>

<p>The effects of Hurricane Harvey have become clear: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/27/harvey-is-causing-epic-catastrophic-flooding-in-houston-why-wasnt-the-city-evacuated/?utm_term=.954c86a0b416" target="_blank">It’s really bad, and it’s getting worse</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over 24 hours, the greater Houston and Galveston area received 24.1 inches of rain. The National Weather Service warned of “additional catastrophic, unprecedented and life threatening flooding” into the next week, and placed flash-flood emergencies for all of Southeast Texas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even worse, the Post says no evacuation order was issued in Houston. That’ll raise questions about the city’s storm preps, but save that for later. This event is expected to play out over the next several days, and it looks progressively dire as it develops.</p>

<p>Now is a good time to <a href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/hurricane-harvey?campname=Harvey" target="_blank">donate to the American Red Cross</a>.</p>

<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/obama-panel-supports-warrant-requirement-for-e-mail-cloud-content/">On my blog: Obama panel supports warrant requirement for e-mail, cloud content</a><br/><p>David Kravets at Ars (bold emphasis is my own):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The laws that govern protections afforded to our communications were written before e-mail, the Internet, and cloud computing came into wide use. Congress should amend ECPA [the Electronic Communications Privacy Act] to ensure the standard of protection for online, digital content is consistent with that afforded in the physical,&rdquo; the panel concluded.</p>
  
  <p>But it&rsquo;s uncertain whether Congress would actually amend ECPA, the privacy law in question that was <strong>adopted during the Reagan era</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Here&rsquo;s why: the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a reform measure last year requiring the authorities to obtain a probable-cause warrant to acquire cloud-based dataâ€”the same Fourth Amendment standard necessary to search the same material if it was on a hard drive in your house. However, an anonymous lawmaker or lawmakers has blocked the measure from going before the full Senate for a yes or no vote.</p>
  
  <p>And that&rsquo;s despite the unheard of support from the Justice Department saying it backs the Senate package to enhance the public&rsquo;s privacy protections.</p>

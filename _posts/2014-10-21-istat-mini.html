<a href="http://www.macstories.net/mac/istat-mini/">iStat Mini</a><br/><p>Federico Viticci:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iStat Mini, released last week on the Mac App Store, takes iStat Menus&rsquo; most popular features and puts them in Yosemite&rsquo;s Today view with a compact widget that&rsquo;s always a swipe away. iStat Mini will show you CPU, memory, and disk usage, with two smaller network indicators at the bottom for downloads and uploads. And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoiler: It&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>

<p>Like Federico, I never really used the full gamut of features that iStat Menus offered. While iStat Mini is extremely light, it could very well be all that I really need.</p>

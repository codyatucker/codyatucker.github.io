<a href="https://fair.org/media-beat-column/the-martin-luther-king-you-dont-see-on-tv/">“The Martin Luther King You Don’t See on TV”</a><br/><p>Jeff Cohen and Norman Soloman for Fair.org in 1995:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).</p>
  
  <p>An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn’t take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.</p>

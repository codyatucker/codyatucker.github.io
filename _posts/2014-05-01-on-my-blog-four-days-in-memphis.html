This was mostly because of an uncomfortable interaction with a man asking for money for which I was took young to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and walk away.  </p>

<p>Instead I tried to be nice, but some beggars on Beale Street are extremely persistent; especially to the nice early-20&rsquo;s kids.  A security guard eventually intervened, saying he had watched us on cameras as we walked down the block with a stranger asking for cash.  If I remember correctly, he firmly told us to never give them money. </p>

<p>Late last year, I made two trips to Memphis after a lengthy hiatus.  I love it.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind living there. </p>

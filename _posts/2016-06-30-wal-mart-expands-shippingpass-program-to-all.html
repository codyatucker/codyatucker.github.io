<a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/wal-mart-expands-free-two-day-shipping-1467238705-lMyQjAxMTE2MzM4MDIzMzA5Wj">Wal-Mart expands ShippingPass program to all customers</a><br/><p>WSJ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Wednesday the retailer said it would open its free two-day shipping program to any U.S. customer, an expansion of the $49 per-year service designed to grab shoppers from Amazonâ€™s popular $99 a year Prime program. Until now Wal-Mart allowed only a limited and undisclosed number of shoppers to sign up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for $50 you can get two-day shipping from Wal-Mart, or pay Amazon $100 for what may be a wider selection, plus movies, TV, music, unlimited photo storage and Kindle books.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good first step for Wal-Mart, and you could argue that some customers don&rsquo;t want all the extra stuff that Amazon offers with Prime. Still feels like Wal-Mart has a long way to go and a short time to get there.</p>

<a href="http://www.codytucker.net/index/twitch-espn">Twitch ≠ ESPN</a><br/><p>In the latest episode of <a href="http://ift.tt/Rf4VMW" target="_blank">The Talk Show</a> John Gruber called Twitch &ldquo;The ESPN of video games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think I understand the point he&rsquo;s trying to make, but I must say there&rsquo;s really no real comparison between ESPN and Twitch.</p>

<p>ESPN is built as a 24-hour news network.  It features anchors, reporters, and commentators following a wide variety of sports, all packaged inside production values that rival or best news organizations around the world.  </p>

<p>Twitch has none of these features.  People simply stream gameplay from their consoles for the world to watch, often with their face in the corner of the screen via webcam and a chat window on the side.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="http://ift.tt/TmNVX6" target="_blank">Gruber</a> and many others are correct when saying there is absolutely nothing odd about Twitch&rsquo;s success.  Watching experts of their craft perform said craft is a phenomenon that is perhaps thousands of years old.</p>

<p>Twitch is <a href="http://ift.tt/1oJGJ3M" target="_blank">similar to ESPN</a> in that people go to the site to watch people play a game, but that&rsquo;s where the similarities end.  </p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s of better service to view Twitch in a lens that includes the likes of YouTube and other streaming video services.  Like YouTube, tens of millions of people flock to the site to watch people play video games (and countless other things).   </p>

<p>There are lots of &ldquo;YouTubers&rdquo; who now make a pretty penny off of videos that feature people playing their favorite games.  </p>

<p>The videos are supremely entertaining.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been in tears laughing at videos from  <a href="http://ift.tt/1ghluwQ" target="_blank">KSIOlajidebt</a> rage out after losing a hard fought battle on FIFA 14.  And you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about popular YouTubers without talking about <a href="http://ift.tt/1hwaajj" target="_blank">stampylonghead</a>.  His Minecraft channel is <a href="http://ift.tt/1g6OuXU" target="_blank">more popular than the Beiber.</a></p>

<p>Twitch fits in with YouTube perfectly because it provides that crucial live element.  Unlike recored and edited videos, Twitch lets you watch gaming wizards <em>right now</em>, and you can interact with them <em>right now</em>.  That&rsquo;s something that goes far beyond ESPN.</p>

It's absurd that it's taken so many years for YouTube (and Twitter and
Facebook) to finally make a move like this. This is basic stuff, yet these companies have spent roughly a decade showing an utter lack of understanding of the effects the rampant spread of misinformation has had on society. It's literally lead to survivors being [abused online](https://www.necn.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Jesse-Hughes-slams-Parkland-shooting-survivors--477949183.html) or in person, and even [killed](). 

They should all be ashamed of themselves, and so too should we all for spending our time on their services while this literal tragedy played out before our eyes. 

I don't think it's a stretch to assume that we'll look back at this era of misinformation as an embarrassing folly of humanity.

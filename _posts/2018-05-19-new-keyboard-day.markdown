Testing the new keyboard. It’s a new Magicforce 68, replacing the Daskeyboard Ultimate that I’ve used since around 2012.

The Magicforce seems nosier than the Das. The new board has Gateron Brown keys, which are supposed to copy the heralded Cherry MX Brown. Upon first use, I think I prefer the real Cherry MX Brown. Time will tell.

Otherwise the form factor is much, much better. Not even close, really. The Magicforce even includes media keys—accessible by the Fn key—which is a huge upgrade from the Das.

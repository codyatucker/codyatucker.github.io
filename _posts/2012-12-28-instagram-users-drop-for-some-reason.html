<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/28/3811358/where-did-a-quarter-of-instagrams-users-go">Instagram users drop for some reason</a><br/><p>Nathan Ingraham:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AppData&rsquo;s measurement only shows that there was a decline in users who have Instagram connected to Facebook — while there&rsquo;s no doubt that represents a sizable and likely representative portion of Instagram users, it isn&rsquo;t the entire Instagram userbase. The decline could come from users unlinking their Facebook accounts; those users could still be using Instagram, but AppData wouldn&rsquo;t have any visibility into that. There&rsquo;s also a question of timing — by December 25th, Instagram had already reversed course on its decision, making the decline oddly timed if it is indeed related to the initial burst of outrage.</p>

<p>AppData&rsquo;s app data is inconclusive.</p>

<p>But how fitting would it be that there actually <strong>is</strong> a wealth of people dropping their Instagram accounts, but not their Facebook accounts?</p>

<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/16/scottchat/?ncid=rss#.dknbga:tvcm">Sony e-mails reveal Scott Forstall as Snapchat advisor</a><br/><p>Josh Constine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But given Forstall’s prestigious pedigree and fame for leading Apple’s iOS division, he was granted a wopping .11% fully-dilluted for merely being an advisor, with the options vesting over 24 months.</p>
  
  <p>If Forstall completes his vesting schedule, that stake would be worth $16.5 million judging by the $15 billion valuation Snapchat was recently reported to be raising money at. And given Snapchat’s strong momentum, Forstall’s equity could be worth much more soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a bad gig if you can get it.</p>

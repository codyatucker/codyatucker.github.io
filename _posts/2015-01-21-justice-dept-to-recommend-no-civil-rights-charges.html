<a href="http://cir.ca/s/tRCB">Justice Dept. to recommend no civil rights charges against officer in Ferguson shooting</a><br/><p>Circa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The Justice Dept. will not bring civil rights charges against former officer Darren Wilson, according to anonymous law enforcement officials cited by the New York Times and the Washington Post. A broader Justice Dept. civil rights investigation into the policing practices of the Ferguson Police Department remains open.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to make a civil rights case here, since he was likely looking for a robbery suspect whose description fit Brown&rsquo;s. I think there is, however, still a case against Wilson’s handling of the situation.</p>

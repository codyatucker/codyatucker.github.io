  <p>As with most keyboards that come with Cherry MX switches, the cost is going to be higher than membrane-based keyboards: $150. And at first blush, it might seem that the CODE Keyboard isn’t all that different from other mechanical keyboards – it has a lot in common with my Rosewill RK-9100 for example. Dig a little deeper however and you’ll find some nice features.</p>

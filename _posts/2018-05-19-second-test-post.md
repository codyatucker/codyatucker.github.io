Here’s another test post, this time testing out the workflow with nvALT, Atom and Github Pages.

nvALT is a good place to write the post, and Atom is a good way to publish the files thanks to it’s Github integration. I’d like to eventually try posting directly from the command line, but I don’t yet have a ton of confidence in my git command work.

I think I like this setup. I want it to be as lean as possible without the need of expensive software. Nothing against that software, but I want to be able to produce this site on all types of hardware, be it an iMac, an iPad or maybe even a Raspberry Pi.

<blockquote>
  <p>After vaguely announcing changes a few months ago, Yahoo has decided that it will stop accepting Facebook and Google logins at Flickr as of June 30. The move is part of Yahoo&rsquo;s emphasis on getting rid of its reliance on its competitors and trying to draw customers directly into its user base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signing in to Flickr has always been awkward. This should help.</p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1idyjup" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

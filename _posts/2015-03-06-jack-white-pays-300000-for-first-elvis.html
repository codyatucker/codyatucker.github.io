<blockquote>
  <p>Jack White has revealed in an interview with Billboard that he was the mysterious bidder on the first vinyl record ever cut by Elvis, which recently sold for $300,000. The record in question featured covers of &ldquo;My Happiness&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s When Your Heartaches Begin&rdquo; that were recorded in 1953. In the interview, White reveals that he was the bidder that was previously listed as anonymous, and he said that he plans to reissue the single (via Third Man Records) on Record Store Day.</p>

<p>Awesome move by Mr. White.</p>

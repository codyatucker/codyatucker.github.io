<blockquote>
  <p>The deal is designed to convince iPad owners to switch to Surface tablets. Microsoft was forced to cut its Surface RT price by 30 percent worldwide after slow sales of the devices and a $900 million write-down. The company has also cut its Surface Pro tablet by $100 recently. Microsoft is holding a special Surface event in New York City on September 23rd where it’s expected to launch the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2.</p>

<p>Looks like you can spend the store credit on anything in the Microsoft store, but that’s still not much of a selling point to me.</p>

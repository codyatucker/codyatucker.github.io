<blockquote>
  <p>Over the last six months, in addition to the product changes, we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse. As an example, allowing bystanders to report abuse – which can now be done for reports of private information and impersonation as well – involved not only an update to our in-product reporting process, but significant changes to our tools, processes and staffing behind the scenes. Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports.</p>

<p>Though they may have been too timid when protecting the rights of free speech, it&rsquo;s good that they&rsquo;re finally getting on top of this. Still, they should have done it much much sooner.</p>

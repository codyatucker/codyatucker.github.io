<blockquote>
  <p>The problem, of course, is that if a system like iOS is capable of being breached by an government agency, it is also feasible that an individual with less noble intentions could do the same. When a company like Apple pushes for greater data security, it isn&rsquo;t doing so to protect criminals, it&rsquo;s doing so to protect the 99% of its users who aren&rsquo;t criminals. Whether sacrificing the privacy of those 99% in order to catch the real &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; is worth it will continue to be debated for a long, long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be no debate. Punishing &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; based on the actions of the fringe is a poor class control tactic in elementary school. To do so at the level the FBI is suggesting is simply reprehensible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHANHASSEN, Minnesota â€” The room was a bit too dark. Prince turned to a member of his staff and said, &ldquo;Turn up the lights so the doves can see.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>This was the beginning of an impromptu, informal, and certainly unexpected late-night conversation between 10 surprised reporters and one of the world&rsquo;s best-known musicians in the studio where he&rsquo;s been making music for more than 30 years. And if you&rsquo;re Prince, your studio is going to have a few birdcages containing live doves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bizarre story, but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less from Prince.</p>

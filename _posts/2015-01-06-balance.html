<blockquote>
  <p>The reality is that it’s hard to come up with a single reason for Apple’s modern software woes. And the most likely explanation is that they’re the result of a series of trade-offs, deadlines, and wrong decisions that contributed to the overall product.</p>
  
  <p>Which brings me to the argument that “Apple should slow down” and “have a Snow Leopard release” (not directly expressed in Marco’s piece). After putting a lot of thought into this, I simply believe it won’t happen and that we’d end up being concerned anyway.</p>

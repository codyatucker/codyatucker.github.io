<p>Cristiano Ronaldo stands aside Lionel Messi as the two greatest footballers on earth.  However, they come from two different worlds, and Ronaldo&rsquo;s road to immortality wasn&rsquo;t quite as clear as Messi&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whoscored.com/Blog/afrjipqbxuymjkqkdeg07q/Show/Player-Focus-Cristiano-Ronaldos-Exponential-Growth" target="_blank">Miguel Delaney plotted Ronaldo&rsquo;s statistical ascendency into what is arguable his prime</a>, and the results were surprising, given the potential of his contemporaries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point to all of this is not just that Ronaldo has obviously improved, honed his game or altered his position. It is that he has gone from a scoring record that was arguably less than mediocre for a talented young winger, to one that is of historic quality for anyone in the sport.</p>
  
  <p>In that context, it is genuinely remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Sunday, Ronaldo scored his 208th goal in 205 appearances.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sh2mqMHyWe0" target="_blank">Even the goal itself was a work of art</a>.</p>

<p>The point is, Spanish football is in a bit of a golden age.  I&rsquo;m very late to the party, but I urge everyone to join in while it lasts.</p>

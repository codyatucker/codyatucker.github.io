<a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-mac">Tweetbot for Mac - $20</a><br/><p>I must admit, the $20 price tag kind of blew me away at first, but if you think about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of Twitter’s recent enforcement of token limits, we only have a limited number of tokens available for Tweetbot for Mac. These tokens dictate how many users Tweetbot for Mac can have. The app’s limit is separate from, but much smaller than, the limit for Tweetbot for iOS. Once we use up the tokens granted to us by Twitter, we will no longer be able to sell the app to new users. Tapbots will continue to support Tweetbot for Mac for existing customers at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They couldn&rsquo;t give it away, and they certainly couldn&rsquo;t have made it cheap.  The high price means people that have no business owning the app will have no reason purchase it.</p>

<p>Now, Tapbots can rest assured that whenever that token cap is reached, they&rsquo;ll only have a large, devoted, enthusiastic user base to support.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the right decision for all of us.</p>

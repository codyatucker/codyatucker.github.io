<blockquote>
  <p>His resignation comes during ongoing investigations into massive FIFA corruption being carried out by U.S. and Swiss officials. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/6/2/8704145/jerome-valcke-fifa-bribes-south-africa-jack-warner-julio-grondona" target="_blank">Revelations on Tuesday</a> saw Blatter&rsquo;s right-hand man Jérôme Valcke implicated in the transfer of a $10 million bribe from South Africa to Jack Warner&rsquo;s Caribbean Football Union back in 2008.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper trail got awfully close to Blatter with that Valcke allegations linked in the quote. A day later, Blatter resigns.</p>

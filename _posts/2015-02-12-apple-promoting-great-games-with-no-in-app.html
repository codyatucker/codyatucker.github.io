<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has started promoting games that don&rsquo;t have any In-App Purchases on the front page of the App Store. Currently featured in the UK App Store and likely expanding to the U.S. store later today as part of the App Store&rsquo;s weekly refresh, the section is called &lsquo;Pay Once &amp; Play&rsquo; and it showcases “great games” that don&rsquo;t require users to pay for extra content through IAPs.</p>

<p>This is just awesome. Good to see Apple taking at least <em>some</em> sort of stance on w touchy issue in app development.</p>

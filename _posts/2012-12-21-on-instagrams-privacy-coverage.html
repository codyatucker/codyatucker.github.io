<a href="http://one37.net/blog/21/12/2012/so-very-very-tired">On Instagram's privacy coverage</a><br/><p>Great stuff from Matt Alexander:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instagram, confronted by thousands upon thousands of misled users, was forced into a public relations nightmare. This was largely incited by a core grouping of alarmist journalists who spend their days twitching over &ldquo;BREAKING&rdquo; macros and publish buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Great</strong> stuff.</p>

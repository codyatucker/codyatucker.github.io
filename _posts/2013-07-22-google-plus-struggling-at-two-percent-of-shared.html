<blockquote>
  <p>Despite Google&rsquo;s efforts to integrate its &ldquo;social layer&rdquo; across all of its services, Google+ trails every other major social networking platform. A new report out from Gigya pegs Google+ at only a two percent share of social sharing, behind even LinkedIn, which holds a three percent share. The social platform is in fifth place among the major social outlets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to use Google+ on too many occasions and it just doesn&rsquo;t do anything for me.</p>

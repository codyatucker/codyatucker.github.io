<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-03/17/nintendo-smart-games">Nintendo is developing games for smartphones – Wired UK</a><br/><p>James Temperton:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mario, Link and Donkey Kong could soon be coming to Android and iOS after Nintendo announced it will start developing games for smart devices. The company said the games wouldn&rsquo;t be ports of existing titles but would be &ldquo;completely new game experiences&rdquo;.</p>
  
  <p>Nintendo will partner with fellow Japanese developer DeNA and both companies creating games as part of the deal. All of Nintendo&rsquo;s franchises are up for grabs, the company confirmed. DeNA is responsible for one of Japan&rsquo;s most popular mobile gaming platforms and specialises in mobile and social games.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;To ensure the quality of game experience that consumers expect from this alliance of Nintendo and DeNA, only new original games optimised for smart device functionality will be created,&rdquo; Nintendo said in a statement. Details of specific titles in development and availability will be announced in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo plans to launch an online membership service as part of the deal. My guess is the games will be free downloads, but you&rsquo;ll have to be a paid subscriber in order to play the game. Nintendo can get use this as a way around the &ldquo;free-to-play&rdquo; shenanigans, but who knows if the service will be worth paying for.</p>

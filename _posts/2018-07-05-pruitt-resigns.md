CNN:

>Pruitt's resignation follows months during which the EPA administrator has been embroiled in one ethics controversy after the next.
>
>It also comes [two days after an exclusive CNN investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/politics/scott-pruitt-whistleblower-secret-calendar/index.html) revealed a former top aide alleged Pruitt and his staffers held regular meetings to "scrub," alter or remove controversial events from his calendar. [That investigation sparked two Democratic congressman](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/pruitt-epa-beyer-lieu-inspector-general/index.html) to call Thursday for the EPA inspector general to investigate whether Pruitt committed a federal crime.

Itâ€™s insane that Pruitt was able to hang on to that position for as long as he did.

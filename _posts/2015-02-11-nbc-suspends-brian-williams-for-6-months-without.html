<blockquote>
  <p>While in the anchor chair, Williams said a helicopter he was on had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while it flew over Iraq in 2003. Members of the military, who were on the helicopter with him, questioned that version of events, and Williams later admitted he had &ldquo;misremembered&rdquo; the episode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a harsh penalty to one of the world&rsquo;s most trusted anchors. It&rsquo;s clear NBC wants to show it takes their credibility seriously, but it&rsquo;s going to be hard for Williams to return from such a punishment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the new Beyoncé album appears to be a major coup for Apple, the price and download restrictions harken back to a time when customers would have to pay in full for every song on a CD.</p>

<p>No it doesn’t. $15 CD’s didn’t come with over 15 music videos. A similar package would have cost 2 or 3 times as much in the era of the compact disc.</p>

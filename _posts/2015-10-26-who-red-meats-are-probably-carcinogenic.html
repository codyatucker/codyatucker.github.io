<p>Allison Aubrey:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, the WHO says red meats including beef, pork, veal and lamb are &ldquo;probably carcinogenic&rdquo; to people.</p>
  
  <p>A group of 22 scientists reviewed the evidence linking red meat and processed meat consumption to cancer, and concluded that eating processed meats regularly increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Their evidence review is explained in an article published in The Lancet.</p>
  
  <p>The conclusion puts processed meats in the same category of cancer risk as tobacco smoking and asbestos. This does not mean that they are equally dangerous, says the International Agency for Research on Cancer â€” the agency within the WHO that sets the classifications. And it&rsquo;s important to note that even things such as aloe vera are on the list of possible carcinogens.</p>

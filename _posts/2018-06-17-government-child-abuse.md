>McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of children wait away from their parents in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.

>One teenager told an advocate who visited that she was helping care for a young child she didn’t know because the child’s aunt was somewhere else in the facility. She said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl’s diaper.
>
>The U.S. Border Patrol on Sunday allowed reporters to briefly visit the facility where it holds families arrested at the southern U.S. border, responding to new criticism and protests over the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy and resulting separation of families.

Important to remember that this is not a law. This is a Trump administration policy that deliberately abuses children. It lacks any connection to basic humanity.

Meanwhile, the The New York Times reports that [“some parents are being deported before recovering their children.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/immigration-deported-parents.html)

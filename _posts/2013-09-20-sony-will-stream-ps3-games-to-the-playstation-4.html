<blockquote>
  <p>Sony’s PlayStation 4 console doesn’t offer traditional backwards compatibility with the PS3 game library. But when the company announced its acquisition of Gaikai last year, gamers immediately began hoping the technology would eventually let them play Uncharted, Heavy Rain, Ratchet and Clank, and other PlayStation hits on the next-gen hardware. To their delight, Sony has now made those plans official.</p>

<p>This is great news. I’m holding out on titles like GTA V as I get ready for the PS4 launch. It’s good to know there’s at least a chance that I’ll be able to play it on a next-gen console.</p>

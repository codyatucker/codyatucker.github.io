  <p>So, we’re improving the reporting process to make it much more mobile-friendly, require less initial information, and, overall, make it simpler to flag Tweets and accounts for review. These enhancements similarly improve the reporting process for those who observe abuse but aren’t receiving it directly. And to enable faster response times, we’ve made the first of several behind-the-scenes improvements to the tools and processes that help us review reported Tweets and accounts.</p>

<p>Very nice. This is one way Twitter can make it’s first-party apps <em>better</em> than third party apps. It looks like something that would be very difficult for a Tweetbot or Twitteriffic to implement, yet it works for the greater good of its users.</p>

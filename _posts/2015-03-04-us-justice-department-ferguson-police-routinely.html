<a href="http://cir.ca/s/zADB">US Justice Department: Ferguson police routinely violate civil rights</a><br/><p>Circa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An investigation by the Justice Dept. found Ferguson&rsquo;s police department routinely violates the constitutional rights of black citizens. The report, which was released March 4, accuses police of regularly making arrests without probable cause, using excessive force and making baseless traffic stops.</p>

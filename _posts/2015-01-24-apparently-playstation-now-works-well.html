<blockquote>
  <p>At a limit of 8 Mbps, the image returned to what seemed like 720p HD and boasted a solid frame rate throughout. At this bandwidth level, the only issues were occasional compression artifacts appearing as small, scrambled boxes of pixels for a few frames here and there. By the time we hit 9 Mbps of download speed, streaming once again felt like local play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That strikes me as a pretty astounding figure. I assumed a 15-20Mbps connection would be considered ideal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really pulling for Playstation Now in the long term. $20/mo is just too expensive. I would bet that when people think &ldquo;streaming service,&rdquo; they immediately think $10/mo ala Netflix. If Sony can find a way to expand the library while simultaneously lowering the price of the service, they might have their killer app.</p>

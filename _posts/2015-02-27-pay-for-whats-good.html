<blockquote>
  <p>Put another way, we’re going to charge something sane or die trying. We tried following the iOS App Store trend by pricing Vesper at just $2.99 for months. It didn’t work. Prices like that are not sane, and not sustainable, at least for well-crafted productivity apps. So Q Branch is drawing a line in the sand, and we hope other iOS developers will follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine for Gruber&rdquo; arguments aside, good for them. Independent developers can, and should, charge a fair price for their life&rsquo;s work.</p>

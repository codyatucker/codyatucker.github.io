<a href="http://www.espnfc.com/fifa-world-cup/story/1949196/germanys-christoph-kramer-has-suspected-concussion">"I can't really remember much of the game"</a><br/><p>ESPN details the last of too many players who suffered a head injury during a World Cup match, yet were still allowed to continue playing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really remember much of the game,&rdquo; he told German newspaper Die Welt after seeing his team-mates beat Argentina 1-0. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything at all about the first half. I thought later that I left the game immediately after the tackle. I have no idea how I got to the changing rooms. I don&rsquo;t know anything else. In my head, the game starts from the second half.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Kramer&rsquo;s head injury on the biggest stage revived concerns about the way football deals with concussions. It was the latest in a series of head injuries at the World Cup that raised questions about the sideline medical checks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a situation in dire need of reform.</p>

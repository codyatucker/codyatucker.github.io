<a href="http://path.com">Path for iOS 6</a><br/><p>I haven&rsquo;t used Path for months, but after seeing it&rsquo;s iOS 6 update, I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>The newest version is <em>really</em> good.  Most apps like Path are plagued by a weird jittery scrolling issue when passing pictures in the feed.</p>

<p>Path&rsquo;s latest version could be the nicest, <em>smoothest</em> social networking app available.  If you haven&rsquo;t used it in a while, it&rsquo;s now time to revisit.</p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/technology/rivals-google-and-apple-fight-for-the-dashboard.html?_r=0">Google and Apple Fight for the Car Dashboard - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>The (hopefully) oncoming arrival of Car Play and Android Auto to the mass market could signal a big change in the auto industry. Finally, companies are letting go of their clunky, in-house digital interfaces and letting in people who actually know what their doing.</p>

<p>The change is detailed in an article from the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While automakers traditionally aimed to control all aspects of the infotainment experience — building their own closed-off, proprietary systems — the results were not always stellar. And the pace of technology meant a car’s hardware and software could become dated quickly.</p>
  
  <p>In some cases, the systems carried what seemed to be needless costs, like an annual fee for updating map software — something unthinkable for any user of Google Maps or Apple Maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toyota is one of the only holdouts left, but I suspect it will be to their detriment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Aristo (Greek for &ldquo;the best&rdquo;) will reportedly sport dimensions of 5.35x2.67x0.35 inches. According to the document, it will have a 4.65-inch screen with a resolution of 1280x720 and a 16:9 aspect ratio. Aristo will also reportedly be an all-touchscreen affair, as is expected to be the case with RIM&rsquo;s L-Series BlackBerry phones.</p>

<p>I remember back when these spec leaks used to be a really big deal.   Give me a &ldquo;user experience&rdquo; leak and then I&rsquo;ll be <em>really</em> excited.</p>

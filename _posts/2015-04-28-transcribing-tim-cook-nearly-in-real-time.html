<blockquote>
  <p>To keep the turnaround between the analyst call and the posting of my transcript as short as possible, I use Rogue Amoeba’s excellent Audio Hijack, which I reviewed here in January. For past calls, I’ve taken notes during the call and then played back a recording in iTunes later, filling in the gaps. This time, I just started transcribing when the call started. A few minutes after the call was complete, I had a full transcript.</p>
  
  <p>In order to make this work, I use Audio Hijack’s Time Shift block, which lets me pause and rewind the audio I’m capturing—TiVo style!—as I listen. During Cook’s prepared remarks, I ended up several minutes behind the live stream, but by skipping over Apple CFO Luca Maestri’s remarks and the questions of analysts, I managed to catch up to nearly live before the end of the call.</p>

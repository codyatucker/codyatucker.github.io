<blockquote><p>Workers outside of the US are paid less than $500 a month to scrub beheadings and dick pics from your Facebook feed. Fascinating report from <strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/" target="_blank">WIRED</a></strong> about the invisible comment moderation industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baybayan is part of a massive labor force that handles “content moderation”—the removal of offensive material—for US social-networking sites. As social media connects more people more intimately than ever before, companies have been confronted with the Grandma Problem: Now that grandparents routinely use services like Facebook to connect with their kids and grandkids, they are potentially exposed to the Internet’s panoply of jerks, racists, creeps, criminals, and bullies. They won’t continue to log on if they find their family photos sandwiched between a gruesome Russian highway accident and a hardcore porn video. Social media’s growth into a multibillion-dollar industry, and its lasting mainstream appeal, has depended in large part on companies’ ability to police the borders of their user-generated content—to ensure that Grandma never has to see images like the one Baybayan just nuked.</p>

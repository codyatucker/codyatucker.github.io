<blockquote>
  <p>Vesper is phenomenally well designed from the graphics, animation, feel, speed, and interaction. It looks and feels great. It’s a fucking Ferrari of note, no, thought collection apps.</p>
  
  <p>And yet I wouldn’t recommend people buy it for the same reason I rarely recommend or argue that people buy a Mac in 2004, an M5 at any time, or an iPhone in 2006.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Ben’s review nails it. Specifically, his liking it to an exotic car.</p>

<p><a href="http://vesperapp.co" target="_blank">Vesper’s</a> only competition exists in apps that are focused in providing the best experience. Not on note-taking apps with a mile-long feature list.</p>

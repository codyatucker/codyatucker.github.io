  <p>However the declination can be overridden if a particular length numerical code is given to the cashier, which usually comes from the bank. When one of Parrish’s four dodgy debit cards (three Chase debit cards and one SunTrust card) was inevitably declined, he would explain to the cashier that he needs to call the bank and find out what’s going on.</p>
  
  <p>Parrish would then give the cashier a code from the ‘bank’ and the transaction would be authorized. How exactly did he know the code? Well the code can be any random assignment of numbers, so long as it’s a particular length. Parrish knew this and just made up the numbers on the spot and handed them over to the cashier.</p>
  
  <p>In a similar case earlier this year, the U.S Attorney’s Office in New Jersey admitted that: “it does not actually matter what code the merchant types into the terminal.  Any combination of digits will override the denial.  So long as the customer provides a fake authorization code and convinces the merchant to enter it into the terminal, the transaction will go through.”</p>

<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check">Fact checking pro-gun arguments</a><br/><p>And while I&rsquo;m on this political tangent, I might as well dig in to the gun debate.</p>

<p>Dave Gilson at Mother Jones looked at 10 of the most used talking points in support of gun rights. Here&rsquo;s one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fact-check: Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0
  â€¢ Chances that a shooting at an ER involves guns taken from guards: 1 in 5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of interesting points in Gilson&rsquo;s post. Read it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Youâ€™ll be able to choose from two subscription plans: one month for $19.99, or a three-month package for $44.99 (about $15 per month). The subscription provides access to a large and diverse catalog of PS3 games, ranging from action to RPG and everything in-between.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will also be a 7-day trial, but at prices like that I can&rsquo;t see myself signing up. Playstation Now has a pretty solid catalogue, and I assume it will get better. Let&rsquo;s hope the price does too.</p>

<p>Euan McKirdy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A senior U.S. administration told CNN it could take days to obtain the scientific data to determine whether this was a successful test.</p>
  
  <p>The South Korean defense ministry said it too could not immediately confirm the test&rsquo;s success, but the country&rsquo;s foreign ministry hastily convened an emergency meeting. Officials in Japan were also holding discussions.</p>
  
  <p>The test took place at 10 a.m. local time, the regime said in a televised statement.</p>
  
  <p>The seismic event, which measured the event at a magnitude of 5.1, occurred 19 kilometers (12 miles) east-northeast of Sungjibaegam, the United States Geological Survey said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You obviously can&rsquo;t take North Korea&rsquo;s word for it, but the seismic event is cause for concern.</p>

<a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/04/29/jony-ive-paints-a-fresh-yet-familiar-look-for-ios-7/">"Very, very flat"</a><br/><p>Rumors of a major-ish redesign of iOS pick up steam, and per 9to5 Mac, we should expect it to be <em>mostly</em> visual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the look of the updated system may be surprising to some, iOS 7 is reportedly not more difficult to use than earlier versions of software platform. There is apparently no new learning curve in the same way there was no learning curve when the iPods went color. While iOS 7 does look different, its core apps and system fundamentals  (like the Lock and Home screens) mostly operate in a similar fashion to how they do today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is true, I&rsquo;ll take it. iOS&rsquo;s functionality lacks features that look good on a spreadsheet, but when such simplicity is met by a massive base of eager developers, amazing things can happen.</p>

The limitations brought by iOS have forced developers to think more efficiently, which leads to works of genius like <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/" target="_blank">Drafts</a>.  I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

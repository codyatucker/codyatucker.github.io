<blockquote>
  <p>After recently prescribing the need for &lsquo;bitter medicine&rsquo; to resuscitate the ailing economy, the Narendra Modi government is, seemingly, working on contours of a social welfare healthcare project to sweeten the deal for the citizenry. For starters, the health ministry&rsquo;s vision is to provide 50 essential generic medicines, free of cost, from &ldquo;birth to death&rdquo; to all Indians across the nation.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty basic essential drugs address 75% of the healthcare needs of the majority, and we plan to make these available free to everyone, from birth to death,&rdquo; Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told HT.</p>
  
  <p>The programme will be rolled out in phases, beginning with select hospitals across India, with the objective of reaching every citizen.</p>
  
  <p>Once the rollout is complete, everyone will get these 50 medicines – that include traditional treatments for pain, infection, hypertension, diabetes, among others – complimentary on prescription at public hospitals and dispensaries.</p>

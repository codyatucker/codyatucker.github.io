<a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">Marco Arment drops top-selling iOS content blocker, Peace</a><br/><p>Just two days after releasing perhaps the best iOS content blocker, Peace, Marco Arment has pulled it from the App Store:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good, which I didn’t anticipate, but probably should have. Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.</p>
  
  <p>Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. This approach is too blunt, and Ghostery and I have both decided that it doesn’t serve our goals or beliefs well enough. If we’re going to effect positive change overall, a more nuanced, complex approach is required than what I can bring in a simple iOS app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arguments over the positives and negatives of iOS content blockers are a hot mess. See <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web" target="_blank">this piece by Nilay Patel</a>, but I think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/because-of-apple" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> is right when it comes to the affect content blockers will have on smaller outlets.</p>

<p>Back to Marco: Peace was built on <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/" target="_blank">a very strong platform built by Ghostery</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t editable like Ghostery&rsquo;s desktop counterpart. You could go in a whitelist individual sites to allow ads from those you trust. That&rsquo;s something you should definitely consider doing in other iOS content blockers.</p>

<p>Marco ultimately decided it&rsquo;s best to just get out of the storm before it gets worse, and it most certainly will. He deserves a great deal of respect for that.</p>

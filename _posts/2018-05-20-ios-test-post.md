Now Iâ€™m testing a way to write a blog post with iOS, using [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) for iPhone. 

I can use [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) snippets to add post front matter and format the file name. Editorial syncs with Dropbox, allowing me to save files that will later go to my Github repository.

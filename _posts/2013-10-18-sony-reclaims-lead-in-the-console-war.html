  <p>The PlayStation 3 was the best-selling games console in the US for September, according to NPD, breaking an impressive stranglehold on the top of the charts that the Xbox 360 had managed to keep for the 32 months since January 2011. NPD analyst Liam Callahan told Gamesindustry.biz that Sony&rsquo;s system was boosted by the release of a Grand Theft Auto V bundle, showing how Rockstar&rsquo;s blockbuster series &ldquo;can shake things up in hardware as well as software.‚Äù</p>

<p>Benjamin Mayo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similar to what has been offered by third-party Twitter clients for sometime, users will be able to hide tweets from specific users or tweets that contain certain keywords from ever appearing in their timeline …</p>

  <p>The Twitter app added muting features for notifications at the end of last year. It will shortly roll out the same capabilities to the home timeline.</p>

  <p>The Twitter app will also include options to hide users that don’t have a profile photo, cutting down abuse from so-called ‘egg accounts’ which typically retain anonymity by using the default Twitter profile pictures. There will also be settings to mute accounts that use unverified contact information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how people were able to go so long using Twitter&rsquo;s stock app <em>without</em> mute filters.</p>

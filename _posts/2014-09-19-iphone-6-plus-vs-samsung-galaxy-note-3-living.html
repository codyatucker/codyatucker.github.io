<blockquote>
  <p>So, the big question for me in testing the iPhone 6 Plus was this: would it, in turn, allow me to leave my Note 3 at home? So far, the answer has been no, not quite &ndash; but it is good enough to have me thinking about carrying both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helps no one. The answer is either yes or no. &ldquo;Both&rdquo; is a cop-out. Maybe Stevens can afford to carry both, but basically every normal consumer can&rsquo;t do that.</p>

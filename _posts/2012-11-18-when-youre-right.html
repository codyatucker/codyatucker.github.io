<a href="http://massivegreatness.com/neutral-or-neutered">When you're right</a><br/><p>MG Seigler, on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/03/editorial-amazon-and-google-are-undermining-mobile-pricing/" target="_blank">Engadget&rsquo;s bizarre editorial apology</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a writer, I feel disgusted reading such an update. As a reader, I feel even worse. It reads as if the Engadget editors think their readership to be morons who can’t think and/or reason for themselves beyond what they’re told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

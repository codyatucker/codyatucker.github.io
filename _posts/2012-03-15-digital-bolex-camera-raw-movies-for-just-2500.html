<a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/153111/digital-bolex-camera-raw-movies-for-just-2500/">Digital Bolex Camera: RAW Movies For Just $2,500</a><br/><p>From their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joedp/the-digital-bolex-the-1st-affordable-digital-cinem" target="_blank">Kickstarter page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Digital Bolex is a “digital cinema camera” or a camera that shoots RAW images (sometimes known as Digital Negatives) instead of compressed video. Unlike the digital cinema cameras used on big budget films, the Bolex is designed with consumers as well as pros in mind, and will be inexpensive, compact, and easy for anyone to use, just like the film cameras many of us remember using as kids.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this turns out.</p>

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2r26n1/blown_away_today_by_apple/">"Blown away today by Apple"</a><br/><p>Great story by Reddit user ElectrifiedPop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first sent it in, and it came back, and it crashed. So I went to the Apple Store in the Galleria in Saint Louis, MO. 5 days later, I got it back again, and sadly crashed once more. Last week I dropped it off the day after Christmas, and today I got it back once more. This was the 3rd time and they basically replaced everything. I got home and started to restore my back up, when once again it crashed.</p>
  
  <p>I was so annoyed, upset but mostly frustrated at the fact this kept happening. I called the store and spoke with the Apple Tech head guy and he told me to bring everything in, and we would go from there.</p>
  
  <p>I got to the store with an hour left before they closed, and when he came out with a new computer I was shocked. The new computer is the more advanced of the Macbook family, and it will come in handy with my photography company. The whole time the Store Manager, Apple Genius guys, and floor people checked up on me as my brand new computer restored. They even let my Dad and I stay after they closed to finish everything. They answered all of my questions, and my parents and they were so sweet and understanding.</p>

<p>My girlfriend once had trouble with her white Macbook. I can&rsquo;t remember what it was. We took it to the very same Apple Store for repair.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was out of warranty (she didn&rsquo;t buy Applecare), but they still fixed it and gave her a huge discount on the repair. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact amount, but it turned the bill from <em>life altering</em> for two college students to <em>perfectly manageable</em>.</p>

<p>Then, they replaced the top casing that was prone to yellowing. They replaced this piece every time she brought it in.</p>

<p>Now we buy Applecare for just about everything. See how that works?</p>

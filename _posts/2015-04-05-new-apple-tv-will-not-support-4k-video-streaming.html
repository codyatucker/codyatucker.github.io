<blockquote>
  <p>When Apple’s next-generation Apple TV finally arrives at market later this year, it will bring a groaning board of new features to the company’s dusty set-top box — as BuzzFeed News first reported. But it will lack one that some Apple watchers had presumed inevitable: 4K video capability.</p>
  
  <p>Sources in position to know tell BuzzFeed News that the 4th generation Apple TV will not support 4K video — a newer high-definition video resolution that delivers a more detailed, immersive picture. “4K is great, but it’s still in its infancy,” said one source familiar with Apple’s thinking.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising at all.</p>

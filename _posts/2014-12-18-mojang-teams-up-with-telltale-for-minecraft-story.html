<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the name, Story Mode isn&rsquo;t an additional campaign in the core Minecraft game, but a separate, &ldquo;narrative-driven&rdquo; episodic series in the standard Telltale model. That means a story that&rsquo;s &ldquo;driven by player choice,&rdquo; which integrates &ldquo;new characters with familiar themes, in an entirely original Minecraft experience, inspired by the Minecraft community and the game that continues to inspire a generation,&rdquo; according to Telltale&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like a smart move to me. Mojang insists that it&rsquo;s just another part of the Minecraft experience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re not intending on creating an “official” story for Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail. It will be a cool game.</p>

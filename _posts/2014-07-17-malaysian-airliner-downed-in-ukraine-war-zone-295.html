<blockquote>
  <p>(Reuters) - A Malaysian airliner was brought down in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 295 people aboard and sharply raising the stakes in a conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow rebels that has set Russia and the West at daggers drawn.</p>
  
  <p>As the United States said the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was &ldquo;blown out of the sky&rdquo;, probably by a ground-launched missile, Ukraine and Russia traded accusations of blame, cranking up global pressure for a way out of a bloody local conflict that risks fueling a new Cold War.</p>
  
  <p>Ukraine accused pro-Moscow militants, aided by Russian military intelligence officers, of firing a long-range, Soviet-era SA-11 ground-to-air missile. Leaders of the rebel Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic denied any involvement and said a Ukrainian air force jet had brought down the intercontinental flight.</p>
  
  <p>But separatists have said that they took control of such a missile system last month and had used it to shoot down a Ukrainian military transport plane that was destroyed on Monday.</p>

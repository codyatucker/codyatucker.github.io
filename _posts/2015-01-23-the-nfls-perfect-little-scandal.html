<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not the complicated stuff we have chosen to forget because we ran out of energy as the league stalled and stalled until the clock ran out. It’s not the commissioner who ignored a domestic violence crisis, then hired the same company that negotiated the league’s latest TV deal to conduct an “independent investigation” to absolve the NFL and commissioner of any wrongdoing. It’s not the concussion problem, either, or the Pro Bowler on trial for allegedly murdering three people over two seasons.</p>
  
  <p>The problem with the NFL is the New England Patriots, who were caught using underinflated footballs that were hypothetically easier to catch in their 38-point romp over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game.</p>

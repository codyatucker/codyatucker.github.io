<a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/01/the-perfect-laptop/">There is no perfect laptop</a><br/><p>Ben Brooks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would a 12” MacBook Air with retina be cool? Probably, but only if it is good and we don’t know enough to know that yet. I’d much rather live in the boring reality and say that your screen sizes should step down nicely from the largest machine to the smallest. And that’s part of the reason I want an iPhone 6+ instead of my iPhone 6.</p>

<p>There is (and never will be) a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; laptop because laptops are a disaster of ergonomics. Using one as it&rsquo;s designed requires sitting, slumped down, as both hands extend at odd angles to operate the device.</p>

<p>The iPhone 6 Plus can be cumbersome at times, but it&rsquo;s overall a much easier device to use than the laptop for many things. One can do work on it while standing completely upright (or curled up in a ball in a dark room, but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>

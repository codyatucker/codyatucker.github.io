<blockquote>
  <p>Widgets are a bit tricky at this point; they’re so new that we as developers haven’t had the time to figure out proper design etiquette, or even determine what widgets are really for. The temptation is to make them big, gaudy affairs, and several weather apps have gone in that direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grossman has gone the opposite route, and I think it&rsquo;s for the better. Previously I&rsquo;ve been using Check The Weather&rsquo;s extension, but it takes up a <em>lot</em> of space on my <em>tiny</em> iPhone 5 screen.</p>

<p>Also, kudos to _David Smith, creator of Check the Weather, for <a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/524325960024616960" target="_blank">letting me know</a> about the update.</p>

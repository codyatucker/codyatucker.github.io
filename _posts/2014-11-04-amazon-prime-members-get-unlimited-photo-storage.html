<a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/prime-subscribers-can-now-store-an-unlimited-number-of-photos-in-amazons-cloud/">Amazon Prime members get unlimited photo storage</a><br/><p>Gigaom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mobile apps automatically upload photos from your phone’s photo roll into Prime Photos, which can be displayed on a variety of devices, including Playstation 3 and 4 as well as Amazon Fire TV. One of the nicest features in Prime Photos is that the apps upload the original version of photos, so you’ll have a full resolution backup in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s yet another place to have all of your pictures saved forever. It&rsquo;s also another place to worry about whether or not your massive collection of personal photos is secure.</p>

<p>Amazon also announced plans to extend <a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/04/amazon-begins-extending-perks-for-prime-members-to-other-shopping-sites/" target="_blank">Prime next-day shipping to other websites, starting with AllSaints.com</a>.</p>

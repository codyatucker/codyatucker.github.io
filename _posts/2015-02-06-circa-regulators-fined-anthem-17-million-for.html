<a href="http://cir.ca/s/7qIB">Circa: "Regulators fined Anthem $1.7 million for unsecured data in 2013"</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>Federal regulators fined Anthem — formerly known as Wellpoint — $1.7 million in 2013 for not securing a database that was accessible over the Internet in 2009 and 2010. 612,402 customers&rsquo; personal and health records were exposed. USAToday reports WellPoint&rsquo;s former chief information security officer holds the same role at Anthem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anthem recently fell victim to a breach that likely compromised the record of millions of people.</p>

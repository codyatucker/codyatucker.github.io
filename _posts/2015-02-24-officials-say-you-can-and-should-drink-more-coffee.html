<blockquote>
  <p>Not only can people stop worrying about whether drinking coffee is bad for them, according to the panel, they might even want to consider drinking a bit more.</p>
  
  <p>The panel cited minimal health risks associated with drinking between three and five cups per day. It also said that consuming as many as five cups of coffee each day (400 mg) is tied to several health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The articles goes on to say that Americans are among the highest coffee consumers on Earth, but they still fall below the threshold of three to five cups.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a report titled, &ldquo;Community-based broadband solutions: The benefits of competition and choice for community development and highspeed Internet access,&rdquo; the White House said it wants to &ldquo;end laws that harm broadband service competition.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Laws in 19 states—some specifically written by special interests trying to stifle new competitors—have held back broadband access and, with it, economic opportunity,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;Today President Obama is announcing a new effort to support local choice in broadband, formally opposing measures that limit the range of options to available to communities to spur expanded local broadband infrastructure, including ownership of networks. As a first step, the Administration is filing a letter with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urging it to join this effort by addressing barriers inhibiting local communities from responding to the broadband needs of their citizens.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solid move.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UN has been trying to deal with this issue since 1992, when the Earth Summit in Rio agreed a non-binding treaty to reduce greenhouse gases, which resulted in emissions rising. In 1997, the Kyoto treaty bound countries to reduce pollution—but the US never ratified the treaty, and China, India, and others were exempt on account of their relative lack of prosperity. The Copenhagen summit in 2009 was intended to take Kyoto a step further, with more binding targets, but collapsed in acrimony as the US led five nations in blocking a deal. And in  2012 in Doha, everyone agreed that it was time for an agreement—to enter force in 2020.</p>

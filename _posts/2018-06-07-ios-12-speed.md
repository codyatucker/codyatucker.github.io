Ron Miller on Monday:

>Apple’s Craig Federighi announced that Apple was doubling down on performance with the upcoming release of iOS 12 at the WWDC event in San Jose, Calif. today.
>
>What’s more, he said, the company would be making these changes to the full range of iOS devices going back to 2013. “And so for iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance from top to bottom making improvements to make your device faster and more responsive. And because we want these changes to be available the full range of our customers, iOS 12 will be available on all the same devices as iOS 11,” Federighi told the WWDC audience.

I’m a faithful iPhone SE user, and while I’m hopeful that Apple will release a revised model this year, a hearty speed bump will help.

I’m much less excited about [macOS dropping support for devices made before 2012](http://osxdaily.com/2018/06/05/macos-mojave-compatible-macs-list/), leaving my 2011 iMac wanting for the new features. You always know that it happen at some point, but it’s still a bit of a bummer.

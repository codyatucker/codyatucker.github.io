> JOMO, is not a misspelling of “mojo” but, rather, stands for “joy of missing out.” The antithesis of FOMO (fear of missing out), JOMO is about disconnecting, opting out and being O.K. just where you are.

I stopped using Twitter around two weeks ago. I had been thinking about it for several weeks beforehand, thinking I would be able to find a "good time" to stop. Instead, I just stopped. I moved Tweetbot to a folder and I haven't interacted with Twitter aside from opening Reddit links and checking my deactivation options. I had already deleted my Facebook accounts weeks before. 

I'm not particularly concerned with taking stock of my digital wellbeing or monitoring my time spent using a particular device. I simply grew tired of giving so much of my attention to this "outrage machine" that's tightly contained in this little app on my phone and computer. 

Many times, the outrage is understandable and often warranted. In many cases, the outrage was directed towards abuse and bots that Twitter failed to act upon substantive until recently, but they're actions that it should have taken *years* ago. 

For news, I stick to my RSS feed and Reddit. For politically-charged pieces posted to Reddit, I try to spend less time reading the comments below the posts.

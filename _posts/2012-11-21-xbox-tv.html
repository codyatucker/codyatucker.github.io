<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft is building an Xbox set-top box. Multiple sources familiar with Redmondâ€™s plans have confirmed to The Verge that the company plans to introduce a low-cost alternative to its Xbox console, designed to provide access to core entertainment services. The move will allow Microsoft to further increase its presence in the living room, providing consumers with a choice between a set-top box or a full next-generation Xbox console.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious move for Microsoft as it would cost them next to nothing to do it.</p>

<p>But, it does gives strength to my biggest concern over next-gen consoles: Will we still be stuck loading games from a disc?</p>

<a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/23/apple-pay-id-law-missouri/">Missouri state rep. proposes law requiring customers to show ID with Apple Pay</a><br/><p>Mike Beasely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Determined to stymie the inevitable flood of fraudulent transactions using Apple Pay and other mobile wallets, one Missouri lawmaker has proposed a new law that would require shoppers to pull out a photo ID and prove they truly are who they say they are before they will be allowed to continue with the process of scanning their unique fingerprint on a high-tech piece of equipment designed specifically for the purpose of verifying their identity without the need for a physical identification card.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, itâ€™s <em>that</em> stupid.</p>

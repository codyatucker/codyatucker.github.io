<blockquote>
  <p>According to Spanish site Motor Y Racing, a US version of the Civic Type R is in the works. The salient part of the Type R that would make the oceanic voyage to US showrooms would be the 2.0-liter turbo four that&rsquo;s said to produce between 276 and 320 horsepower, but we could expect upgraded suspension, rolling stock and other equipment to come as part of the package as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s a long time coming. Honda is getting crushed in the performance compact category by Ford, Volkswagen, and even Fiat. Bringing over the Type-R engine would put them right back at the top of the heap.</p>

<p>PLUS, rumors also say that same engine could find it&rsquo;s way into he CR-Z. That&rsquo;s big news to a former CRX driver like myself.</p>

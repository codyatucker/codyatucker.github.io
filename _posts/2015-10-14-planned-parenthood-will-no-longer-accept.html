<blockquote><p>In an effort to move beyond recent controversy, Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday that it will no longer accept reimbursement for any fetal tissue it provides to medical researchers.</p><p>The women’s health group has been the subject of negative attention in recent weeks following the release of highly edited <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/15/423212004/undercover-video-targets-planned-parenthood" target="_blank">sting videos</a> recorded by an anti-abortion group alleging that Planned Parenthood illegally profits from its fetal tissue donation program.</p><p>NPR’s Jennifer Ludden reports that “Planned Parenthood points out that reimbursements are legal but says it wants to debunk accusations that it’s just out to profit. Officials also say they won’t stop providing fetal tissue to researchers when women request [it]. They say such research can lead to life-saving treatments.”<br/></p><p><i><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/13/448288996/planned-parenthood-will-no-longer-accept-reimbursement-for-fetal-tissue?utm_source=tumblr.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=2038" target="_blank">Continue reading.</a></i></p></blockquote>

<p>I assume the GOP will only categorize this announcement as an admission of guilt.</p>

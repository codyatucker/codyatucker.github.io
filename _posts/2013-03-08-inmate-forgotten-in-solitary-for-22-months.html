<blockquote>
  <p>The New Mexico county that locked him up on a drunk driving charge, isolated him from other inmates and accused of essentially forgetting about him for nearly two years agreed this week to settle his lawsuit for $15.5 million.</p>
  
  <p>Slevin, now 59, went to jail in August 2005 as &ldquo;a well nourished, physically healthy adult,&rdquo; but emerged with a long beard, bed sores, bad teeth and weighing just 133 pounds in June 2007, according to the lawsuit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He even had to pull his own tooth, despite his cries for help.</p>

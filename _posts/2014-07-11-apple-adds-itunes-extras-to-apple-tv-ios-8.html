  <p>As Apple explains, “iTunes Extras can include behind-the-scenes videos, short films, high-resolution image galleries, directors commentary, scenes and more.” The iTunes Extras are included in HD movies.</p>
  
  <p>Because iTunes Extras are in the cloud, movie studios can update or add extras at any time, giving users a more dynamic experience. This could include any of the content mentioned above, or other bonus material from the filmmakers.</p>

<p>Glad it’s finally here, but it took far too long for Apple to make this happen. Fortunately, the company is doing its part to make sure it’s done right.</p>

<p>&gt;Iwata was an enormous force not just at Nintendo, but in gaming. He led Nintendo through the eras of the GameCube, Wii, DS, 3DS, and Wii U, and he worked on Earthbound, Pokemon, Kirby, The Legend of Zelda, Smash Bros., and countless other titles. These are consoles and games that filled my childhood with joy, which I spent literally thousands of hours playing. The games alone account for some of the biggest successes in the industry, and many of their sequels continue to entertain millions of people around the world.</p>

<p>I was 18 or 19 when I finally got around to the GameCube. Later on I got a Wii, which left me tons of memories thanks to games like Super Mario Galaxy, Tiger Woods Golf, and Mario Kart Wii. </p>

<p>With the massive success of the Wii and the DS, it&rsquo;s easy to realize how Iwata&rsquo;s Nintendo made a massive impact on children and families around the world.</p>

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/01/charging_usb_only_macbook">MagSafe ideas for the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air</a><br/><p>A great idea was sent John Gruber&rsquo;s way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Maybe it’ll still have MagSafe, but somewhere else on the cable.</em> A lot of readers suggested that the MagSafe connector could move to the AC adapter, or that you’d use a MagSafe-to-USB-Type-C dongle. Requiring a dongle would be gross (and easily lost). I’m not sure what to think of a MagSafe connector on the AC adapter, but something along these lines seems like the most likely answer.</p>

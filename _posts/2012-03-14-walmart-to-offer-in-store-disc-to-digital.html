I don&rsquo;t have a very large collection, but if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider dragging them all to Walmart (of all places) and have them converted for $2-$5 a pop.</p>

<p>Consider the &ldquo;used buy back&rdquo; market:  People bring drums of DVDs <strong>that they longer watch</strong> to sell or trade in for cash or store credit.  Asking people to pay to convert movies that they likely have no intention of ever seeing again seems like a pretty hard sell.</p>

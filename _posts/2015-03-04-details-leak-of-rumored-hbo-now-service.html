<blockquote>
  <p>HBO’s cable-free streaming service will be called “HBO Now” and cost $15 per month, according to International Business Times. HBO is reportedly trying to launch the service by April 12, in time for the fifth-season premiere of Game of Thrones.
  “We know there’s great anticipation around our standalone streaming service,” HBO said in a statement, responding to questions about the report. “And when we have details to share, we will do so.”</p>

<p>This is going to be <em>major</em>. If this doesn&rsquo;t send a big signal to cable companies and networks, nothing will.</p>

<p>This is a great move.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/23/moto-x-update-camera/?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget&amp;ncid=rss_semi" target="_blank">As reported by Engadget,</a> Anandtech calls it &ldquo;nothing short of the biggest [improvement] I&rsquo;ve ever seen come across in an OTA update.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem inherent with all Android updates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The refresh, which is so far getting pushed out to T-Mobile phones &ndash; we expect it to roll out to other carriers as soon as each one is done testing the new firmware, though nothing is currently confirmed&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is perhaps the biggest stumbling block when it comes to recommending an Android phone.  I had the same problem when I used Blackberry, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/09/blackberry-sold/" target="_blank">look how all that turned out</a>.</p>

<p>With Apple, OS updates may be slightly staggered, but they are not dictated by a carrier.  Where Blackberry updates would take months to land on customers phones, iOS updates are a available within roughly a day or so of its release.</p>

<p>And it works.  Apple announced today that <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html" target="_blank">200 million devices have already been updated to iOS 7</a>.  With that news, developers know there&rsquo;s already a massive market that&rsquo;s waiting for them to use the absolute latest features brought by iOS.</p>

<p>So whether it&rsquo;s enjoying all the new features baked in to iOS, or finding that great app made by a lone developer, all this makes for an incredibly exciting environment to spend your time.</p>

<p>I spend a ridiculous amount of time on my iPhone and iPad reading, communicating, and writing for this site.  And I know I can do so with all the latest and most innovative software, as securely as possible. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true with Android, <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/9/23/platform-updates-and-the-rate-of-innovation" target="_blank">at least not yet. </a> These facts made it easy to choose and iPhone over Blackberry, and it&rsquo;s those that continue keeping me from choosing Android.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like Nintendo&rsquo;s Wii U is finally getting the shot in the arm it needs: according to the latest numbers, the console&rsquo;s sales jumped 200 percent last month. The company points to the Wii U&rsquo;s August price drop and the introduction of a limited-edition Legend of Zelda bundle for the increased interest, the former of which parrots the company&rsquo;s success with cutting the 3DS&rsquo; original price back in 2011.</p>

<p>Good for Nintendo.</p>

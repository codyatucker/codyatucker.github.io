<blockquote>
  <p>Well, when it comes to the battery at least, owners of Apple Watch will be able to extend its lifespan. An Apple spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch the “battery is replaceable”. Albeit, it’s not clear how much it will cost to send in your wearable to Apple to get it returned with a new cell in place.</p>

<p>I assume it&rsquo;s similar to all of Apple&rsquo;s devices: It&rsquo;s possible to do but, depending on which model you have, it may not be entirely cost effective.</p>

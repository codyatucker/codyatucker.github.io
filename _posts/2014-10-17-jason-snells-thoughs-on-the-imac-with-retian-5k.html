<a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/10/apples-ipadmac-event-first-thoughts/">Jason Snell's thoughs on the iMac with Retian 5k Display</a><br/><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s the most practical solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, this display is an iMac—and not an external display. But it makes sense, in a way. Getting this much video data out of a computer and into a monitor can be hard. What makes it easier is if you just connect the computer directly to the display and create a single product that’s got the computer and display integrated. You know, like a Retina iMac. And so here we are… at least for now.</p>

  <p>Just as striking was what the list excluded: attacks targeting Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism.</p>

  <p>The list does not mention, for instance, two suicide bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed dozens in November 2015, or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria, which have been among the world’s deadliest terrorist assaults.</p>

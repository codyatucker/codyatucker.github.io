<a href="http://www.technologizer.com/2014/06/01/wwdc/">A Decade’s Worth of WWDC Keynotes</a><br/><p>On WWDC Keynote Eve, here&rsquo;s a pretty cool retrospective of Keynotes past, including reactions form the press. </p>

<p>The inclusion of preview gifs for each one is a really nice touch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, I’m a WWDC keynote fan myself–there’s nothing more important to hardware than the software which it runs, so the focus on operating systems and apps makes these events more interesting to me, not less so. But as we gird ourselves for Monday, it might help to calibrate expectations if we review the last ten years of WWDC keynotes.</p>

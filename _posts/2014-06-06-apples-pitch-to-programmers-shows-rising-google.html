<blockquote>
  <p>With Google trying to lure coders and designers to create more for its Android mobile software, Apple used its event to introduce new features to keep them in the fold. The iPhone maker showed improved methods for customers to find apps to download, a new programming language to create apps more quickly, and tools so the programs can work seamlessly together.</p>
  
  <p>The announcements represent Apple’s most comprehensive set of enhancements for developers since the company debuted its App Store nearly six years ago. For much of that period, the world’s most valuable company had a near lock on programmers as iPhones and iPads proliferated, giving developers a vast audience who could download their games and other widgets. Yet Google’s Android has since seized market share and others such as Facebook Inc. have rolled out tools to cater to developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now-more so than ever-it can be argued that Apple is &ldquo;open&rdquo; in a way that Google could only dream of.</p>

<p>All of these developer tools are available for apps that can run on a massive majority of devices being used in the market right now. <a href="http://ift.tt/1jWNqYK" target="_blank">The same can not be said for Android</a>.</p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1oAkPNd" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

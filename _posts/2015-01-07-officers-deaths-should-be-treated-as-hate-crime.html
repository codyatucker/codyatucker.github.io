<a href="http://cir.ca/s/bwHB">Officers' deaths should be treated as hate crime, union leader says</a><br/><p>Circa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite a long-term decline in police fatalities, with a slight increase to 126 in 2014, police unions have joined conservative groups in calls for greater protection from what they see as ideologically motivated attacks. In a Jan. 4 op-ed, Canterbury said assaults on police should be treated as hate crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense that someone supporting law enforcement would push harsher punishment as an effective deterrent to a problem plaguing the country.</p>

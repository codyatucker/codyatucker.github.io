<a href="http://www.slashgear.com/tim-cook-isnt-gay-for-you-30353288/">Tim Cook isn’t gay for you</a><br/><p>Excellent piece from Craig Davies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suggestion from some has been that Cook&rsquo;s sexuality is a non-issue. I suppose, if that really were the case, today&rsquo;s openness - and the CEO&rsquo;s sacrifice of privacy - is similarly for naught. Personally, though, I think there&rsquo;ll be more than one struggling person who gains strength from his openness. The fact that Cook is now the sole openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list suggests that, contrary to the commentary, we&rsquo;re not yet at a place where it simply &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; any more.</p>

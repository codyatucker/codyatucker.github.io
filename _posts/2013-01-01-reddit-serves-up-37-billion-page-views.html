<blockquote>
  <p>The most popular post was President Obama&rsquo;s AMA, which had almost 5.6 million views â€” more than double that of any other post on the site. Reddit&rsquo;s massive popularity and growth is no surprise: some quick math shows that it averaged over three billion pageviews each month in 2012, a 50 percent uptick from the two billion it reported for the month of December, 2011.</p>

<p>Congrats to a good place.</p>

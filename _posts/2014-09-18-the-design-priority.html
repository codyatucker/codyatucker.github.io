  <p>Usability is at the top of the list and carryability is second fiddle now, Android got there first, but Apple paved the way for it through user adoption of the platform. Thatâ€™s why there is a bump for the camera: to try to get the phone small enough in your pocket that you will still carry it, even though doing so may feel less ideal than the last version of the iPhone.</p>

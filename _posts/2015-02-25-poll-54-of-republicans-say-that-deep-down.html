<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8108005/obama-muslim-poll">Poll: 54% of Republicans say that, "deep down," Obama is a Muslim - Vox</a><br/><p>Max Fisher:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over half of Republicans answered &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; when asked which religion describes President Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;deep down&rdquo; beliefs, according to a newly released poll by Alex Theodoridis of the University of California at Merced.</p>
  
  <p>Theodoridis, who released the results on Wednesday on the Washington Post political science blog Monkey Cage, asked Americans this question: &ldquo;Which of these do you think most likely describes what Obama believes deep down? Muslim, Christian, atheist, spiritual, or I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The poll was conducted in the fall of 2014.</p>
  
  <p>The results, divided by party affiliation, are shown above. And they&rsquo;re pretty staggering. Among Republicans, 54 percent answered &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; when asked what Obama believes; only nine percent said &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; his stated religion.</p>

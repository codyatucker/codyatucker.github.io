<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3911972/vine-hands-on-twitter-takes-on-video-sharing">Vine is actually pretty cool. </a><br/><p>It&rsquo;s made by Twitter, and as Russell Brandom writes, it&rsquo;s pretty simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shooting is remarkably simple. You start from a standard camera view, and hold down your finger to shoot. By tapping and releasing, you can easily shoot a quick montage without having to edit. A gradually filling bar above the viewfinder shows you how much time you have left. (There were rumors of a slow-motion mode for the iPhone 5, but we weren’t able to duplicate it. As far as we’re concerned, they’re still rumors.) One quirk: Vine doesn&rsquo;t auto-rotate, so you have to shoot videos with your phone in portrait rather than landscape, or they come out sideways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Videos play like a GIF with audio. Very clever, though the infinite looping can be a bit annoying.</p>

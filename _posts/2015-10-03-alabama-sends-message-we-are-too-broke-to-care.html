<blockquote>
  <p>Take a look at the 10 Alabama counties with the highest percentage of non-white registered voters. That&rsquo;s Macon, Greene, Sumter, Lowndes, Bullock, Perry, Wilcox, Dallas, Hale, and Montgomery, according to the Alabama Secretary of State&rsquo;s office. Alabama, thanks to its budgetary insanity and inanity, just opted to close driver license bureaus in eight of them. All but Dallas and Montgomery will be closed.</p>
  
  <p>Closed. In a state in which driver licenses or special photo IDs are a requirement for voting.</p>
  
  <p>It&rsquo;s not just a civil rights violation. It is not just a public relations nightmare. It is not just an invitation for worldwide scorn and an alarm bell to the Justice Department. It is an affront to the very notion of justice in a nation where one man one vote is as precious as oxygen. It is a slap in the face to all who believe the stuff we teach the kids about how all are created equal.</p>

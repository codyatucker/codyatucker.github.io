<a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple - Privacy</a><br/><p>The Tim Cook money quote that everyone is quoting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t “monetize” the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scroll to the bottom and read how Apple manages privacy from the device level to the government level. This is another reason why I choose to do business with Apple.</p>

<a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/10/12/6962857/why-canceling-school-for-columbus-day-is-a-terrible-idea">Canceling school for Columbus Day is dumb</a><br/><p>Libby Nelson explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s a better way to use Columbus Day: Make kids go to school that day, as they already do in 27 states. Celebrate Columbus Day by encouraging teachers to talk about the complicated legacy of Columbus in American history (including the day&rsquo;s significance for Italian-Americans, who still faced discrimination themselves when it was established in 1937). Going to class on Columbus Day and talking about history makes the day a reason to explore America&rsquo;s past, not just an excuse for mattress sales. As it is now, it&rsquo;s not just a logistical headache for parents â€” it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity for real learning.</p>

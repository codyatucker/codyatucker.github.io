<blockquote>
  <p>More specifically, Twitter appears to be fine-tuning its focus on TV. Earlier this year, Twitter bought Bluefin Labs and Trendrr, both of which specialize in tracking the chatter around TV programming.</p>
  
  <p>Twitter declined to comment on its future ad plans, citing the “quiet period” required after an IPO filing. But it’s easy to see how advertisers would gladly pay for data that gives them insight into consumer opinion around specific topics like TV shows or a new snack food.</p>

<p>Watch any live WWE event and you’ll see a similar plan in motion. It’s 3-hour RAW telecast is dominate by which superstar or situation is trending.  It even periodically displays “Twitter Ticker” featuring tweets from fans.  It’s clever business for both parties, and it’s annoying.</p>

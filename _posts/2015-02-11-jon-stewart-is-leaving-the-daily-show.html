<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Stewart, whose contract with Comedy Central ends in September, disclosed his plans during a taping of the program on Tuesday. Saying that “in my heart, I know it is time for someone else” to have the opportunity he had, Mr. Stewart told his audience that he was still working out the details of his departure, which “might be December, might be July.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This breaks my heart. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m amongst millions of people whose ideals and world-view have been informed by Stewart&rsquo;s insight. No matter how grim the subject matter, Stewart&rsquo;s humor has helped give me hope through countless crises.</p>

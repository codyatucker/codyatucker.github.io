<a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast-mac">Instacast for Mac</a><br/><p><strong>Finally</strong>, my iOS podcast list is on my Mac.</p>

<p>For years, podcast listening was mostly relegated to my driving ritual.  If there was an episode that I <em>had</em> to listen to, I would play from Instacast on iPad, using it&rsquo;s speaker.</p>

<p>That ends today.  I suspect my podcast listening habit will increase by about 100%.</p>

<p>The Mac beta is simple, light, fast, and syncing worked instantly on the very first try.  I just hope they add swipe gestures soon. <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast-mac" target="_blank">Get it</a>.</p>

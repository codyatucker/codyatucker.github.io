<a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/11/dropbox-microsoft-office-partnership/">Dropbox and Microsoft form a tag team</a><br/><p>The Dropbox blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We know that much of the world relies on a combination of Dropbox and Microsoft Office to get work done. In fact, Dropbox is home to over 35 billion Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. That’s why we’re partnering with Microsoft to help you do more on your phones, tablets, and the web. Soon you’ll be able to access your Dropbox directly from Office apps, and edit Office files from the Dropbox app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart move from both parties involved, especially for enterprise and school environments that for some reason still haven&rsquo;t gotten away from Office.</p>

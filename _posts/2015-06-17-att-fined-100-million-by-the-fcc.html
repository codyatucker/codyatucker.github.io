<blockquote>
  <p>The Federal Communications Commission slapped AT&amp;T with a $100 million fine Wednesday, accusing the country&rsquo;s second-largest cellular carrier of improperly slowing down Internet speeds for customers who had signed up for &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; data plans.</p>
  
  <p>The FCC found that when customers used up a certain amount of data watching movies or browsing the Web, AT&amp;T &ldquo;throttled&rdquo; their Internet speeds so that they were much slower than normal. Millions of AT&amp;T customers were affected by the practice, according to the FCC.</p>
  
  <p>The fine, which AT&amp;T says it will fight, is the largest ever levied by the agency.</p>

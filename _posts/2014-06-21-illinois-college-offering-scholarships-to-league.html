<blockquote>
  <p>Robert Morris University in Chicago put out a call recruiting League of Legends players to its first varsity eSports team earlier this month. According to Riot Games, RMU will become the first university to offer a competitive team at the varsity level, and will offer scholarships to players &ldquo;of up to 50 percent tuition and 50 percent room and board.&rdquo;</p>

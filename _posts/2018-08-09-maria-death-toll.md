AP:

> Puerto Rico is estimating in a report to Congress that Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people, though an island official said Thursday that the confirmed toll remains frozen at 64 pending a scientific review due out soon.
> 
>The government, relying on updated statistics it first reported in June, said in a report to Congress detailing a $139 billion reconstruction plan that there were 1,427 more deaths from September to December 2017 than the average for the same time period over the previous four years.

One [recent estimate](https://codytucker.net/blog/2018/05/29/Maria-death-toll.html) set the death toll above 4,000. The government’s report is below that, but Public Safety Department Secretary Hector Pesquera says it’s numbers don’t tell the full story of the disaster. 

> The figure of more than 1,400, Pesquera said, "is simple math" based on the number of excess deaths. "This is not the official number of deaths attributable to Hurricane Maria," he said.

<a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/regret/">A call for action </a><br/><p>Benjamin Brooks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I urge Marco Arment, and others, to admit that the way they reacted to Samantha Bielefeld was wrong. I urge them to condemn the actions of their “supporters” (whether they want those supporters or not, those supporters look to them for guidance).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arment and others were quick to pounce on Bielefeld, which led to a range of attacks that were unacceptable. In light of those attacks, Arment&rsquo;s silence is deafening.</p>

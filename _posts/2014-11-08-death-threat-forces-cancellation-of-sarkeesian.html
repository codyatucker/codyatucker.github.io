<blockquote>
<p>Ars Technica:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarkeesian took to her Twitter account to confirm that cancellation, stating “police wouldn’t take steps to prevent concealed firearms at the event” and “requested pat downs or metal detectors after mass shooting threat, but because of Utah’s open carry laws, police wouldn’t do firearm searches.” As Sarkeesian noted earlier, this speaking event would have been the third in which she had been anonymously threatened with violence in an attempt to prevent her from speaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s embarrassing to live in a country where adolescent gun rights ideologies can prevail over the basic freedom of speech and expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One doesnt trump the other.  The are both rights we are granted among others.  Give up one, give them all up.  Read the history of America, its Constitution, Bill of Rights and the Federalist papers. Then maybe you will get a perspective why the founding fathers thoughts all these rights are important.</p></blockquote>

<p>The open carry laws, not the second amendment, are what allowed the threat of a mass shooting to prevail over an individual&rsquo;s right to speak. Open carry laws as they pertain to the second amendment are open to interpretation.</p>

<p>On &ldquo;give up one, give them all up&rdquo;: Allowing open carry laws to &ldquo;trump&rdquo; the right to speech is, based on your own argument, allowing the second amendment to trump the first amendment. It&rsquo;s rather troubling that you&rsquo;ve read the constitution, bill of rights, and federalist papers, and then molded the writing to fit your ideologies.</p>

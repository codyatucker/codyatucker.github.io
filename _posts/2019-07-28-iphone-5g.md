Juli Clover at MacRumors:

>The three iPhones expected to launch in 2020 will feature support for 5G, according to a new note to investors shared today by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and obtained by MacRumors.

>Kuo originally said that two of the three new iPhones coming in 2020 will support 5G, but now believes that Apple will offer 5G in all models to better compete with lower-cost Android smartphones that will support 5G. Kuo also says that following Apple's acquisition of Intel's smartphone modem chip business, Apple has more resources for developing the 5G iPhone.

I wonder if they should name this one "iPhone 5G". They obviously didn't to an "iPhone 4G" or "iPhone LTE", but with all the buzz around 5G, it might be a decent way to get away from these awkwardly numbered naming patterns.

<a href="http://recode.net/2014/12/02/pc-gaming-juggernaut-steam-tests-twitch-competitor/">Steam Broadcasting announced</a><br/><p>Eric Johnson at Recode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s pretty similar in that regard to Twitch, the game-streaming site acquired by Amazon for $1.1 billion in August. But there’s one big difference: Currently, Steam Broadcasting requires that both the broadcaster and the viewer opt in to the beta service from their account settings.</p>
  
  <p>Valve’s announcement of the beta emphasizes the one-to-one benefits of game streaming —such as demonstrating for a friend how to beat a tricky level or just showing off — but it will also be possible to broadcast to strangers. After one friend requests access to a game stream, broadcasters are given the choice to open it up to just that person, many friends, or all Steam users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first tendency is to compare it to Twitch, but I think we&rsquo;re better off comparing it to the built-in &ldquo;social spectating&rdquo; features on the Xbox One and PS4.</p>

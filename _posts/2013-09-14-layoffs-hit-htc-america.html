<blockquote>
  <p>In a letter about the layoffs obtained by The Verge, President of HTC Americas, Jason Mackenzie, told his team that it was &ldquo;the most difficult day of my HTC career&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the stark reality is that our business results are not where we want them to be.&rdquo; He also promised that HTC &ldquo;would treat the impacted employees with the respect they deserved and provide them with resources to help bridge them to their next opportunity.&rdquo; Mackenzie said the layoffs were &ldquo;part of a broader plan to simplify our organization, sharpen our teams focus, improve our speed in decision-making, and drive greater empowerment through our team, while reducing our overall cost structure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a shame. I briefly handled an HTC One at the local Best Buy, and it&rsquo;s the likely the only Android phone that I&rsquo;ve had any interest in trying again (though I&rsquo;ve yet to try out a Moto X).</p>

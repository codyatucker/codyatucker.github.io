<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/how-facebook-squashed-twitter/">"How Facebook Squashed Twitter"</a><br/><p>Great piece by Ben Thompson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, having a feed that users willingly return to day-after-day is the foundation of successful mobile advertising companies, especially Facebook. As I noted back in 2013 the feed allows for an advertising unit that is actually superior to anything found on the desktop: users have no choice but to at least visually engage with whatever is dominating the screen of the mobile device that is the center of their lives.</p>
  
  <p>In fact, I would argue that the feed is so important that its development — or lack thereof — is the core reason why Facebook has soared over the last ten years, while Twitter has slumped after a beginning that suggested the exact opposite sort of outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still use Twitter more than Facebook, but I&rsquo;ve slowly started adding Facebook back into my daily reading experience. Doing so required using the News Feed similarly to how I use Twitter.</p>

<p>That meant unfollowing basically everyone and then hitting the &ldquo;like&rdquo; button on feeds that I&rsquo;m interested in; websites, bands, brands and people I actually like.</p>

<p>Now I have a news feed that&rsquo;s actually a &ldquo;News Feed.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more closely tailored to things I&rsquo;m interested in while supplementing my Twitter use quite well. Sometimes it&rsquo;s even better.</p>

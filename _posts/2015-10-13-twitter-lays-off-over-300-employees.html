<a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/13/twitter-will-cut-more-than-300-employees-8-percent-of-staff/">Twitter lays off over 300 employees</a><br/><p>Recode with Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s full statement to employees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The roadmap is also a plan to change how we work, and what we need to do that work. Product and Engineering are going to make the most significant structural changes to reflect our plan ahead. We feel strongly that Engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce. And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.</p>
  
  <p>So we have made an extremely tough decision: we plan to part ways with up to 336 people from across the company. We are doing this with the utmost respect for each and every person. Twitter will go to great lengths to take care of each individual by providing generous exit packages and help finding a new job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a tough call to make. I hope Twitter pulls through in helping all of those laid off today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Jul. 26, 1945, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of Japan under threat of “prompt and utter destruction”.</p>
  
  <p>Two days later, newspapers reported that the Japanese government had officially rejected the proposed ultimatum. Soon after, the world’s first atomic bomb was dropped over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, killing an estimated 70,000 people instantly upon detonation.</p>
  
  <p>Three days later a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. With the effects of radiation, the total number of the victims is thought to be approximately 340,000 people. On August 15, 1945, the surrender of Japan was publicly announced and World War II was brought to an end.</p>

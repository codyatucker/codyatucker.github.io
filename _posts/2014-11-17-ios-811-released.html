<blockquote>
  <p>iOS 8.1.1 is out for the public. I&rsquo;ve been using it since it entered beta and it&rsquo;s really solid. If you&rsquo;ve been experiencing the nasty iCloud bug that causes some apps to crash on launch, this fixes that. Share menus will also now remember when you move extension icons around, so you can reorder them and they won&rsquo;t change back when you exit the menu.</p>

<p>The issue with the share menus has been so annoying. I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s taken so long to fix, but at least it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, however, the time has come to discontinue support for the app. The cost of providing weather data to it has grown to large to sustain. It has been operating at a slight loss for the last 2 years, which I didnâ€™t mind providing as I used the app myself. However, a recent change in the pricing for my radar data provider has made it infeasible to continue providing weather data for the app.</p>

<p>Sad day. I enjoyed Check The Weather as my main weather app for years.</p>

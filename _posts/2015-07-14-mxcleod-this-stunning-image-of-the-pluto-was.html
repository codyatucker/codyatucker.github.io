<blockquote><p>This
 stunning image of the Pluto was captured from New Horizons at 
about 4 p.m. EDT on July 13, about 16 hours before the moment of closest
 approach. The spacecraft was 476,000 miles (766,000 kilometers) from 
the surface after traveling more than 9 
years and 3+ billion miles.</p><p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5HTXKMoaFL/" target="_blank">Image Credit: NASA<br/></a></p></blockquote>

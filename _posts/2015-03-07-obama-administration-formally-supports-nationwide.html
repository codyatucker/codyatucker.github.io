<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/06/politics/obama-nationwide-same-sex-marriage/">Obama administration formally supports nationwide gay marriage - CNN.com</a><br/><p>Ariane De Vogue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Same-sex marriage “incompatible with the Constitution,” the Obama administration Friday filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court in support of couples who are making challenges in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;The marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights, responsibilities and status of civil marriage,&rdquo; Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote. He said the states have &ldquo;burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches, from the mundane to the profound.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>The brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide.</p>
  
  <p>The court will hear arguments in the state cases on April 28.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Timing is everything.</p>

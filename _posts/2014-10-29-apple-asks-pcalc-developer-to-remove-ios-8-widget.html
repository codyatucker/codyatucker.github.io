<blockquote>
  <p>As tweeted by PCalc developer James Thomson today, he will be forced to remove the app&rsquo;s iOS 8 widget. Following an approval that saw PCalc 3.3 launch alongside iOS 8 and a feature in Apple&rsquo;s “Great Apps for iOS 8” App Store section, the company has informed Thomson that “Notification Center widgets on iOS cannot perform any calculations”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curious decision by Apple. Their reasoning is pretty dense since, as Viticci mentions, Apple has a calculator extension for Yosemite, but not iOS 8.</p>

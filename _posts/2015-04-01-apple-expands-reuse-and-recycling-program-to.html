<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today has expanded its Reuse and Recycling program to include non-Apple devices such as PCs and Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone smartphones from HTC, Nokia, LG and others. According to MacRumors, this new trade-in program is available in the United States, the UK and several other European countries.</p>

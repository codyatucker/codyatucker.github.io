<a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/news/christian-bale-in-talks-to-star-in-jobs-1201330878/">Christian Bale in talks to play Steve Jobs in new biopic</a><br/><p>He&rsquo;s perfect for the role. He can play virtually any character, mimicking any accent with ease. He was the best Batman, plus he can do incredible things with his body to match characters like Dicky Eklund in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_9" target="_blank">The Fighter</a>. Those skills should bode well in helping him transform in the way Jobs did throughout his career.</p>

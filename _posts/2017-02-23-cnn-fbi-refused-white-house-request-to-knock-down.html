<p>CNN deserves credit for breaking the story, thanks to Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz, Manu Raju and Pamela Brown:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Washington (CNN)The FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump&rsquo;s associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign, multiple US officials briefed on the matter tell CNN.</p>

  <p>But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was only made after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate.
  White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14.</p>

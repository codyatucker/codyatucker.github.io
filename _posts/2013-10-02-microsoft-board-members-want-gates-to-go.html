<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft is now looking for a new CEO, though its board has said Ballmer&rsquo;s strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having trouble seeing how Gates could be blamed for so many projects being handled so poorly while Ballmer was CEO.</p>

<p>Suzanne Goldenberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is nearly 27 years now since a Nasa scientist testified before the US Senate that the agency was 99% certain that rising global temperatures were caused by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
  
  <p>And the Senate still has not got it â€“ based on the results of three symbolic climate change votes on Wednesday night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s wholly embarrassing. It&rsquo;s ultimately terrifying, as well. Not only because we have leaders who refuse to accept the facts, but that so many Americans still vote such people into positions of power.</p>

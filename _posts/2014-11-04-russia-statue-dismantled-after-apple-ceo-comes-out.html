  <p>MOSCOW (AP) — A two-meter statue of an iPhone on a university campus in St. Petersburg has been taken down in response to last week&rsquo;s announcement by the CEO of Apple that he is gay.</p>
  
  <p>In a statement, ZEFS, which according to its website owns construction, advertising, and finance enterprises in St. Petersburg, describes Tim Cook&rsquo;s revelation &ldquo;a public call to sodomy.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>ZEFS said Monday it was taking down the statue because it violated Russia&rsquo;s controversial law protecting minors from homosexual propaganda. The law has been condemned by critics as a means of repressing sexual minorities in the country.</p>

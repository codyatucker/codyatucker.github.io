<p>Julia Boorstin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is upgrading its mute feature — instead of just allowing users to mute accounts they don&rsquo;t want to see tweets from, now users can mute words, phrases and notifications. That means instead of getting a notification when you&rsquo;re mentioned in a hateful conversation, there&rsquo;s no indication it&rsquo;s happening.</p>

  <p>To prevent those abusive comments from being posted in the first place, Twitter is upgrading its tools to allow users to directly report different types of conduct that violates Twitter&rsquo;s policies — anything that specifically &ldquo;targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>More specific reporting will make it easier for Twitter to process complaints faster, and more quickly help the person experiencing the abuse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating that Twitter is implementing these changes <em>after</em> the election. CEO Jack Dorsey said the company was looking into changes <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/26/jack-dorsey-on-twitters-harassment-problem-abuse-is-not-part-of-civil-discourse/" target="_blank">months ago</a>. Obviously, these things take time, but today&rsquo;s changes couldn&rsquo;t have come soon enough.</p>

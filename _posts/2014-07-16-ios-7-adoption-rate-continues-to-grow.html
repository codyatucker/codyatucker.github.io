<blockquote>
  <p>Apple&rsquo;s iOS 7 adoption rate continues to grow, even as the release of iOS 8 approaches. As of yesterday, 90 percent of devices connected to the App Store are running iOS 7, according to new numbers posted on Apple&rsquo;s App Store developer support page.</p>
  
  <p>The new milestone, which comes 10 months after the operating system&rsquo;s original release, is a three percent increase from installation numbers of 87 percent back in April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say it enough, the importance of OS adoption is critical to any mobile platform. Right now, a significant portion of iOS users are running the most secure and up-to-date version possible. That&rsquo;s good for everyone.</p>

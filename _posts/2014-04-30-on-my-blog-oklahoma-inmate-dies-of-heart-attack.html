<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oklahoma-inmate-dies-of-heart-attack-after-botched-execution/">On my blog: Oklahoma inmate dies of heart attack after botched execution</a><br/><p>CBS News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The execution of Clayton Lockett, 38, began at 6:23 p.m. when official administered the first of three drugs. A doctor declared Lockett to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m.</p>
  
  <p>About three minutes later, however, Lockett began breathing heavily, writhing on the gurney and straining to lift his head from the pillow. The condemned man could be seen speaking, CBS affiliate KOTV in Tulsa reported. </p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;It was a horrible thing to witness. This was totally botched,&rdquo; said Lockett&rsquo;s attorney, David Autry.</p>
  
  <p>A doctor then lifted the sheet that was covering Lockett to examine the injection site and determined that his vein had ruptured, said Robert Patton, director of the Department of Corrections.</p>

Peter Baker:

>In the 19 months starting after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the economy has created 3.58 million new jobs — but that is still shy of the 3.96 million created in the last 19 months of Mr. Obama’s presidency. The nation’s economy has grown at a steadily higher pace in the past year than it did during the end of Mr. Obama’s term, reaching an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year. But the last time it was that high was in 2014 — when Mr. Obama was in charge.

> Moreover, even the faster growth under Mr. Obama or Mr. Trump remains modest compared with some previous recoveries. During the first half of this year, the economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized pace, slower than every year of the Reagan recovery, which averaged 4.4 percent between 1983 and 1989.

As this piece later states, Obama was notoriously reluctant to take a victory lap as the economy improved. That appears to be changing ahead of a crucial election.

<blockquote>
  <p>The land — two tracts in Maine and North Carolina that, combined, are roughly two and a half times the size of Manhattan — will be managed by The Conservation Fund. This land is part of an estimated 45 million acres of private forest in the U.S. that are in danger of being lost to development.</p>
  
  <p>“Apple wanted to work with an organization that had the ability to acquire and manage these forests, and we’re thrilled about this partnership,” Larry Selzer, The Conservation Fund’s president, told BuzzFeed News. “Apple is doing something unprecedented here.”</p>
  
  <p>Though Apple will harvest pulp from these forests, other companies will also be able to buy fiber from them as well. Selzer’s organization will manage the forests under the “working forest” model, in which trees are harvested with what Daniel Brindis, a senior Forests Campaigner with Greenpeace, described to BuzzFeed News as “an eye toward the long-term economic well-being of the forest.”</p>

<p>Apple does not have to do this sort of thing.</p>

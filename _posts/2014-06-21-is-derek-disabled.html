<a href="http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruth.php">Is Derek disabled?</a><br/><p>Ricky Gervais explains the character behind <a href="http://ift.tt/1pQbCj5" target="_blank">his incredible TV series</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But here&rsquo;s the thing; Derek WAS meant to be different. He was meant to be marginalised by society. He was meant to draw assumptions by uncaring, thoughtless people who needed to label and pigeonhole individuals for their own peace of mind. He was meant to surprise and undermine stereotypes. And he was meant to look odd, speak funny, have bad hair and no fashion sense and not give a fuck about such things because he knew they weren&rsquo;t important. He knew what was really important. Kindness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, Iwata did not attend E3 on advice from his doctor not to travel overseas. Later in the month, he underwent surgery to deal with a growth found in his bile duct, which in a note to company shareholders he acknowledged could be difficult to treat.</p>
  
  <p>Satoru Iwata was the fourth president of Nintendo, succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi, who had led the company into its modern identity as a titan of video gaming. Iwata had been a programmer for HAL Laboratory, today known for the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, before taking Nintendo&rsquo;s top job in 2002.</p>
  
  <p>As president of Nintendo, Iwata oversaw the introduction of two of the company&rsquo;s most profound successes â€” the Nintendo DS line of handhelds, and the Wii, both of which substantially widened the video game market in the preceding decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sad day.</p>

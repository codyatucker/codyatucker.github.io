<blockquote>
  <p>A leaked internal Walgreens memo obtained by MacRumors suggests that Apple Pay will go live on Saturday, October 18. Apple Pay, of course, represents Apple&rsquo;s foray into the world of mobile payments. The service promises to be extremely secure and rather quick and easy to use. The number of merchants at launch will be relatively small (~220,000), but that figure is likely to mushroom in the coming months. Recall that all merchants who accept credit and debit cards will be incentivized to upgrade their POS machines to more modern models by October 2015.</p>

<p>Seems likely that Apple will confirm the date during <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/" target="_blank">Thursday&rsquo;s special event</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instagram announced Wednesday that it now has 300 million monthly active users, up 50 percent in just nine months.</p>
  
  <p>That makes the service, a photo- and video-sharing app owned by Facebook, more popular than Twitter, which had 284 million monthly active users as of the third quarter. More than 70 percent of Instagramâ€™s users are outside the United States, the company said.</p>

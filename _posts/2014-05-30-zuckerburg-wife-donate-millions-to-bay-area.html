<blockquote>
  <p>The first $5 million will go to school districts in San Francisco, Ravenswood and Redwood City and will focus on principal training, classroom technology and helping students transition from the 8th to the 9th grade. The couple and their foundation, called Startup: Education, determined the issues of most urgent need based on discussions with school administrators and local leaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good move. This needs to be done <em>everywhere</em> by <em>everyone</em> sitting on piles of cash.  It&rsquo;s our only hope. </p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1roWAqH" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

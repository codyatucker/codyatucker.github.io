<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/15/major-update-to-ios-twitter-app-includes-real-time-count-updates-links-opening-in-safari/">iOS Twitter update brings UI refresh, more</a><br/><p>Ben Lovejoy at 9to5 Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, Like and Retweet counts update dynamically, so you can see instantly the engagement generated by a tweet.</p>
  
  <p>Second, you can add filters and stickers to your profile photo.</p>
  
  <p>Third, and most welcome of all, links now open in Safari instead of Twitter’s own browser. This means that you’re now logged into websites where you have an account. It also provides access to Reader View.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks a lot better than the previous app, and I can&rsquo;t believe it took so long to implement Safari View Controller. Still, there&rsquo;s a lot of text everywhere all the time, and it remains too hard to access lists, which I use now more than ever.</p>

<p>Both Tweetbot and Twitteriffic allow me to set tabs at the bottom of the screen for quick access feeds dedicated to news, soccer, tech and automotive news. For example, this allows me to keep the minute-to-minute noise of the news cycle outside of my main feed, yet it&rsquo;s always available the second I want to dive in. List support adds a remarkable layer of depth to the Twitter experience, and the service is significantly less useful without it.</p>

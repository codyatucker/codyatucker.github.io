<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">Because Reading is Fundamental</a><br/><p>Jeff Atwood writes his thoughts on how websites can help people read articles before diving into the hell of the comments section. First, he makes a fabulous comment that everyone should take not of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find that the value of conversations has little to do with how much people are talking. I find that too much talking has a negative effect on conversations. Nobody has time to listen to the resulting massive stream of conversation, they end up just waiting for their turn to pile on and talk, too. The best conversations are with people who spend most of their time listening. The number of times you&rsquo;ve posted in a given topic is not a leaderboard; it&rsquo;s a record of failing to communicate.</p>
</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sir-jonathan-ive-the-iman-cometh-7562170.html">An Interview With Sir Jonathan Ive</a><br/><p>The London Evening Standard scored an interview with Sir Jonathan Ive, and it is predictably filled with quotable quotes. 
Like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goals are very simple - to design and make better products. <strong>If we can’t make something that is better, we won’t do it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Committees just don’t work, and it’s not about price, schedule or a bizarre marketing goal to appear different - they are corporate goals with scant regard for people who use the product.</p>
</blockquote>

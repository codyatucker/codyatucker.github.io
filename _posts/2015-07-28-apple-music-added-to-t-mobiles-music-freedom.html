<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/07/apple-music-exempted-from-t-mobiles-data-limits-and-throttling/">Apple Music added to T-Mobile's 'Music Freedom' program</a><br/><p>Jon Brodkin at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple&rsquo;s new music streaming service will no longer count against T-Mobile&rsquo;s limits on high-speed data. T-Mobile announced the expansion of &ldquo;Music Freedom&rdquo; today, which in total exempts 33 music services from data limits imposed on certain customers.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Apple Music has become the single most requested new addition to Music Freedom and counts for a full 80% of the requests coming in via Twitter. I heard every one of them, so itâ€™s happening right now!&rdquo; T-Mobile US CEO John Legere wrote today.</p>
  
  <p>T-Mobile today also said that customers who buy the iPhone 6 this summer under its so-called &ldquo;JUMP! On Demand&rdquo; installment plan can swap it for the next iPhone without any new fees &ldquo;and no change to your monthly payment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>T-Mobile is still making crazy aggressive moves to bring in customers. I love it.</p>

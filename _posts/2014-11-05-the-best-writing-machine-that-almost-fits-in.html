<blockquote><p>Yuvi gives his very honest and no-punches-pulled assessment of the iPhone 6 Plus as a writing tool. As someone who has long used his iPhone for a primary writing tool, I could not resist the read (and am glad I did).</p></blockquote>

<p>My iPad 3 has finally gotten so slow that I do just about everything on my iPhone 5. &ldquo;Everything&rdquo; generally involves lots and lots of writing, messaging and shifting files between apps.</p>

<p>After a while, I began wishing for a slightly wider device to make it easier to type on. Apple did just that with the iPhone 6, but the 6 Plus goes even further with the incredible battery life.</p>

<p>I never really understood the push for big mobile phones, but the productivity aspects of the 6 Plus are winning me over. I would still hate talking on one, but I rarely talk on my phone without a headset.</p>

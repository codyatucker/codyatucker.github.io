<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130226/when-an-ipad-isnt-enough/">Walt Mossberg's terrible advice </a><br/><p>A reader tells Walt Mossberg what he “needs”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave my wife an iPad for Christmas and she is delighted with it. Unfortunately, I discovered that it would be useless for my purposes. I would need a tablet that acts like a desktop or laptop but is smaller and lighter. Specifically, I would need a tablet that would allow me to have three browsers open and visible on the screen simultaneously. Are there any tablets that would allow me to do this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea why anyone would need three browsers open at a time, but whatever.</p>

<p>Mossberg’s response is even more bizarre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d suggest you look at one of the new Windows 8 tablets that are powered by a laptop-class Intel processor and can run full, standard Windows. Perhaps the best known of these may be Microsoft’s Surface Pro, but there are others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a terrible suggestion. First, I would say if the only reason you’re holding out on a iPad is the need for a bunch of browser windows, it’s time to seriously rethink your workflow.  Walt closes with this warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A warning, though: These tablets are typically heavier, pricier and have less battery life than an iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Way less.</em> So much less, they shouldn’t even be recommended. If one needs more functionality than an iPad, then laptops are the only legitimate option. There are plenty of light, powerful laptops for either operating system that would serve his needs much better than a hopelessly compromised Windows 8 tablet.</p>

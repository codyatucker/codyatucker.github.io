<a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/02/21/sonys-playstation-less-plays.html">Sony's talk show</a><br/><p>Rob Beschizza:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a presentation that dragged on for hours, Sony failed to show the assembled game press the gadget they were there to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My only hope is that, since this is 2013, the hardware of the device simply doesn&rsquo;t matter. All that matters then, is the <em>experience</em>; the feel of the controller and the quality of the service.</p>

<p>But if that were the case, Sony would have spared the press on tech specs, and saved that useless information for the developers at a later date.</p>

</a><br/><p>I agree with just about everything here, except it don&rsquo;t think Leo Laporte has become a &ldquo;Glenn Beck of podcasting.&rdquo;  However, I&rsquo;ve hardly watched <a href="http://www.twit.tv" target="_blank">Twit network</a> since they moved to the new studio.</p>

<p>Still, every podcast on this list is worth a listen.</p>

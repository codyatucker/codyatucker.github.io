<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/iphone-5s-initial-miscellany/">iPhone 5s Initial Miscellany</a><br/><p>Shawn Blanc thinks over his newly-purchased iPhone 5s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone 5s, with its better camera and Touch ID sensor, make it more useful (even if slightly so) to me than the iPhone 5. Moreover, with iOS 7 and so many new and updated 3rd-party apps, we are ever getting more utility, usefulness, and delight from of our iPhones.</p>

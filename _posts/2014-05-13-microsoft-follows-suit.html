<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/rumor-xbox-live-to-remove-gold-requirement-for-netflix-hulu/">Microsoft follows suit</a><br/><p>Sam Machkovech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can report that multiple sources within Microsoft have been briefed on plans to make a long-awaited change to the Xbox Live Gold paywall for streaming media services. According to our sources, Xbox 360 and Xbox One users will soon no longer need a paid subscription to Xbox Live Gold to access Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming media apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the Ars report states, several other products have allowed access to those services for a far lower point of entry throughout the past several years. </p>

<p>Microsoft should have made this move years ago. </p><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1nD4KZZ" target="_blank">Permalink</a></p>

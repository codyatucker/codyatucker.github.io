<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/12/twitter-sharpens-strategy-to-win-over-investors/">Twitter's only strategy is to make money</a><br/><p>Here&rsquo;s their new &ldquo;strategy statement&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reach the largest daily audience in the world by connecting everyone to their world via our information sharing and distribution platform products and be one of the top revenue generating Internet companies in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that someone with a brain wrote everything until the second &ldquo;and&rdquo;. Even that is 6 characters over Twitter&rsquo;s tweet limit, but then some corporate douchebag made sure to tack on the third &ldquo;and&rdquo;, along with what followed.</p>

<p>If this is how Twitter&rsquo;s going to operate, they&rsquo;re strategy should simply read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make as much money as possible regardless of the quality of the product, which is in a constant state of decline and make a lot of money and make more money.</p>
</blockquote>

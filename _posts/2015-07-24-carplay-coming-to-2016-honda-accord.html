<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking at the event, Honda’s American Research and Development head Frank Paluch promised that the manufacturer will begin supporting both CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in their upcoming models. To start with, the 2016 Honda Accord will be the first model to get CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a 2015 Civic Si. The head unit in the upcoming Accord <em>appears</em> to be the same as the one in my car. I really hope Honda adds CarPlay to older, compatible models via some kind of firmware update.</p>

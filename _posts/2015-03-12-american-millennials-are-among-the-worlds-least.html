<blockquote>
  <p>When the results were analyzed by age group and nationality, ETS got a shock. It turns out, says a new report, that Millennials in the U.S. fall short when it comes to the skills employers want most: literacy (including the ability to follow simple instructions), practical math, and — hold on to your hat — a category called “problem-solving in technology-rich environments.”</p>
  
  <p>Not only do Gen Y Americans lag far behind their overseas peers by every measure, but they even score lower than other age groups of Americans.</p>
  
  <p>Take literacy, for instance. American Millennials scored lower than their counterparts in every country that participated except Spain and Italy. (Japan is No. 1.) In numeracy, meaning the ability to apply basic math to everyday situations, Gen Yers in the U.S. ranked dead last.</p>

<p>Education is everything.</p>

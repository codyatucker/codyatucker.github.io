<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the most interesting news about Apple’s new iPad Air 2 tablet is buried at the bottom of one of its marketing pages: It will come pre-installed with a new “Apple SIM” card instead of one from a specific mobile operator.

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty mind-blowing&hellip;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple SIM gives you the flexibility to choose from a variety of short-term plans from select carriers in the U.S. and UK right on your iPad. So whenever you need it, you can choose the plan that works best for you—with no long-term commitments. And when you travel, you may also be able to choose a data plan from a local carrier for the duration of your trip.</p>

<p>&hellip;and I can&rsquo;t believe Apple didn&rsquo;t draw more attention to it.</p>

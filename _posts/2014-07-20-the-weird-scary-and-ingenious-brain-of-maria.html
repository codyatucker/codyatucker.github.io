<blockquote>
  <p>She is bolstered, she says, by hard facts. A subscriber to AARP Magazine, she enjoys citing studies about health and longevity. A few years ago, after reading in a book that people who feel a strong sense of community have been proven to lead longer and happier lives, Bamford started working to overcome her natural shyness and fear of interaction by saying hello to her neighbors in Eagle Rock, a diverse and partly gentrified area on the northeastern edge of Los Angeles. She bought a park bench and had it installed on the median strip in front of her house. She then spray-stenciled the words “Have a Seat!” on the sidewalk in front of it. To her delight, the bench is often occupied. “It’s like a bird feeder for humans,” she says.</p>

<p>Maria Bamford is amazing. One of my all time favorite comics. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-special-special-special/id884477595" target="_blank">Buy The Special Special Special</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ask-About-New-God-DVD/dp/B00D3ZJBLS" target="_blank">her other special</a>.</p>

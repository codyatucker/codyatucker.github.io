<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not going to go into the deep, murky and often truly horrendous GamerGate controversy — the best explanation of the story thus far comes from Deadspin’s Kyle Wagner. What I am going to do is ask, what will it take for explicit threats to be taken seriously, for decisive action to be taken to protect people from gun violence? That’s actually a trick question. Because given what we already know from what we’ve experienced repeatedly in our country and from the persistent, tenacious hold that the gun lobby has on it, the answer is: We already have a body count, and nothing’s changing.</p>
  
  <p>You know how long it’s been since a man with a gun and a desire to punish women went out and killed a bunch of people near a school? Less than five months. Less than five months since Elliot Rodger murdered six people and injured thirteen others. Isla Vista. Aurora. Sandy Hook. Welcome to America.</p>

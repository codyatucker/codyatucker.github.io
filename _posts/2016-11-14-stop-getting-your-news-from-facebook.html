<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook is many things, but it’s not a news source. Facebook’s job is to keep you clicking, and it does that by tweaking your newsfeed so you only see what you want to see. Go to Facebook to talk to friends, but go elsewhere for your news.</p>

<p>Facebook is but <em>one</em> way to find news, but it should not and cannot be your only way.</p>

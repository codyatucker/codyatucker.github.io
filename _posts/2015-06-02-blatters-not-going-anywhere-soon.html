<a href="http://www.espnfc.us/fifa-world-cup/story/2476623/fifa-president-sepp-blatter-resigns-amid-corruption-scandal">Blatter's not going anywhere soon</a><br/><p>Per ESPN FC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking at a news conference in Zurich, Blatter said he would remain in his position until a special election can be held to appoint his successor.</p>
  
  <p>Domenico Scala, the chairman of FIFA&rsquo;s Audit and Compliance Committee, said an election would be held sometime between December 2015 and March 2016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new president won&rsquo;t be chosen until a four month window that begins five months from now. Did he go through with last week&rsquo;s presidential election (for which he won) to buy himself time to play a role in choosing his successor?</p>

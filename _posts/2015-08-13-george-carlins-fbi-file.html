<blockquote>
  <p>Documents from the FBI reveal that J. Edgar Hoover took personal offense to comedian George Carlin following his appearances on â€œThe Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &ldquo;Jackie Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Carlin was a stand-up comedian whose set list included topics as diverse as language, religion, psychology, and politics. He is renowned for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMkNsMMvrqk" target="_blank">&ldquo;Seven Dirty Words&rdquo;</a> routine, which played a vital role in the 1978 Supreme Court case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_v._Pacifica_Foundation" target="_blank">FCC v Pacifica Foundation</a>.</p>

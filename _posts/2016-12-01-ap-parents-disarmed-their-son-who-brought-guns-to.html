<blockquote>
  <p>BOUNTIFUL, Utah (AP) â€” Police said two fast-acting Utah parents disarmed their 15-year-old son at a Utah junior high school Thursday after the teenager brought the family&rsquo;s shotgun and handgun to school and fired a round into the ceiling of a classroom without injuring anyone.</p>

  <p>Bountiful Police Chief Tom Ross said the boy&rsquo;s mother and father became concerned about their son Thursday morning. They went to Mueller Park Junior High in the northern Utah city of Bountiful when they noticed a handgun and shotgun were missing from their home. Ross said the parents confronted their son and disarmed him.</p>

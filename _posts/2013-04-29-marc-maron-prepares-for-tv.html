<blockquote>
  <p>Q:  Is it hard not to be jealous of his success?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A: I would have to assume that the first guy that sang “kumbaya” was doing it because he was furious. To generalize, I’d say that the competitiveness people feel can be applied to any business. No matter what your feelings are, if they’re inappropriate or come across as bitter, you learn to keep them to yourself. There’s diplomacy to it; it’s being a grown-up. But it’s my assumption that we’re all kind of competitive. The trick is to realize that everything in the world is not a threat to you.</p>

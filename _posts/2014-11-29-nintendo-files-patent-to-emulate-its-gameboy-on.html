<blockquote>
  <p>NeoGAF member RÃ¶sti has found a Nintendo patent that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has just made public. It allows for Gameboy emulation on other hardware, most notably mobile phones. The patent also allows for emulation on the seat-back displays of airplanes, or trains, and the ever modern PDA.</p>

<p>Remember, a filed patent doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the product making it&rsquo;s way to the market. However, it does stick with Nintendo&rsquo;s skill of getting the most out of low-end hardware.</p>

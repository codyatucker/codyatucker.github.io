<blockquote>
  <p>Apple asks that users check their device on the site if their sleep/wake button has stopped working completely, or works inconsistently. If you qualify, youâ€™ll then be able to get your device repaired, either in person at an Apple Store or authorized service provider, or by sending your iPhone in for treatment via mail. If you opt for carry-in, you can also get an iPhone 5 loaner model, which Apple will supply in 16GB variants only for use while your own device is having its sleep/wake button replaced.</p>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;m going to the Apple Store in a few days.</p>

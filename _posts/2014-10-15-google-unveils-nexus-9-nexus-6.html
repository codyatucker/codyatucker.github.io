<a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/">Google unveils Nexus 9, Nexus 6</a><br/><p>Just a day ahead of Apple&rsquo;s iPad announcement that just leaked out everywhere on accident, Google unveiled updates to its Nexus line. It includes a 9-inch table, a 6-inch phone, and a Roku/Apple TV-like player thing.</p>

<p>I really like the tan color offered up on the back of the Nexus 9, while Motorola is absolutely killing it with its hardware design. I&rsquo;m surprised Google didn&rsquo;t announce these with at least a little bit of fan-fare.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also curious to see where the phone-size race ends up. Google&rsquo;s flagship phone now comes in one size, a whopping 6-inches. I&rsquo;m considering buying the iPhone 6 Plus, but I&rsquo;m not sure I can deal with 5.5-inches on a daily basis. I could really use the battery life and the improved two-handedness, but where in the world would I put it?</p>

<p>With the Nexus 6, Motorola has done a great job at taming the bezels to make the phone as small as possible, but there&rsquo;s no question that this is a (another) massive phone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Twin Peaks Restaurant is known to host biker gangs as well as bikini-clad waitresses that locals call “Twin Peak Girls,” according to the New York Daily News. Swanton blamed restaurant managers for the incident, saying that the Waco Police Department has tried to get Twin Peaks to stop hosting gang members.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We had been made aware that they were coming &ndash; this could have been stopped,&rdquo; he said. We have attempted to work with management of Twin Peaks to no avail. They continue to allow these bikers to come here.&ldquo;</p>

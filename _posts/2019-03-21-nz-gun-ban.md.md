Anna Fifield at the Washington Post:

> CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand —  New Zealand has banned military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Thursday, just six days after attacks on two mosques in Christchurch that left 50 people dead.
> 
> A buyback program will be launched to take existing weapons out of circulation, and gun owners who do not comply will be subject to fines, she said.
> 
> “On 15 March, our history changed forever. Now, our laws will, too,” Ardern said. “We are announcing action today on behalf of all New Zealanders to strengthen our gun laws and make our country a safer place.”

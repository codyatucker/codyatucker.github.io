<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/indigenous-people-day-replaces-columbus-seattle-26005980">Seattle to Celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day</a><br/><p>As Phuong Le writes, some disagree with the change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Columbus Day is a federal holiday that commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus, who was Italian, in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492. It&rsquo;s not a legal state holiday in Washington.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t argue with the idea of Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Day. We do have a big problem of it coming at the expense of what essentially is Italian Heritage Day,&rdquo; said Ralph Fascitelli, an Italian-American who lives in Seattle, speaking outside the meeting.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;This is a big insult to those of us of Italian heritage. We feel disrespected,&rdquo; Fascitelli said. He added, &ldquo;America wouldn&rsquo;t be America without Christopher Columbus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguing what Columbus Day &lsquo;essentially&rsquo; is or isn&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s not a good enough reason to oppose the change. If you want an Italian Heritage Day, that&rsquo;s an entirely worthwhile endeavor. Such heritage can be honored much more effectively when not naming it after a genocidal maniac.</p>

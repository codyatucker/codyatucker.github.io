<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/1/8700115/microsoft-wunderlist-acquisition">Microsoft reportedly buys Wunderlist</a><br/><p>Chris Welch at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Wunderlist buy represents Microsoft&rsquo;s latest move to boost its mobile presence and cover all bases around productivity software; Acompli checked off email, Sunrise was calendars, and Wunderlist gets the company a well-regarded to-do app. Wunderlist has earned favorable reviews among Android, iOS, and Windows Phone users. (Desktop versions also exist for Windows and OS X.) Back in March the company launched redesigned apps with smarter task management. Without any direct confirmation from Microsoft or Wunderlist, it&rsquo;s too soon to know Microsoft&rsquo;s plans for the app. Acompli was quickly folded into the company&rsquo;s product portfolio, while Sunrise has so far remained more independent and retained its original branding.</p>

<p>Wunderlist is my favorite to-do app. Great buy for Microsoft, but I hope they keep it separate.</p>

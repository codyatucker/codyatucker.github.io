<blockquote>
  <p>The move appears to be motivated by business considerations, based on an internal document obtained by SlashGear, which noted that Rite Aid is working with a consortium of retailers to develop a rival mobile wallet.</p>
  
  <p>Both retail pharmacy chains are members of the Merchant Customer Exchange, a company created by retail heavyweights including Walmart, Best Buy and Target.</p>
  
  <p>The joint venture, formed in 2012, plans to launch its own mobile payment app, CurrentC, next year. Once launched, it will be accepted at 110,000 merchant locations around the country â€” competing directly with Apple Pay and Google Wallet.</p>

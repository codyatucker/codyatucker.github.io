  <p>Thrusting forward to the front of the crowd, Mahmoud Bas from Damascus in Syria called out for a doctor to help his young son who had fallen into a faint while waiting in the cold. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hot on the bus, then cold and rain out here, it&rsquo;s making the children sick, everyone is just tired, exhausted, totally exhausted&rdquo; he said, as volunteer medics splashed water on seven-year-old Mohammed&rsquo;s face and gave him sugar. Others waiting in the wind-whipped field included an elderly woman in a wheelchair paralyzed from the waist down and a mother who sobbed as she sat in the mud cradling her seven year-old son who has a wasting disorder</p>

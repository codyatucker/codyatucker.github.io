<p>Emil Protalinski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows 10 had 9.00 percent market share in November, and gained 0.96 percentage points to hit 9.96 percent in December. Growth has slowed a lot over the last few months: Windows 10 jumped almost 5 percentage points in its first month, but has only gained a little over 1 point each month since. In December, that figure was less than 1 point. This year, Microsoft will be attempting to counter that slowdown, starting with making Windows 10 a “recommended update” so that Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users are more likely to install it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The event took place on Sunday in Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. More than 1.5 million people from all walks of life, ranging from students and housewives to government officials, planted a total of 6,67,50,000 tree saplings in just 12 hours. A total of 24 districts of Narmada river basin were identified for the plantation. The saplings included two-dozen varieties of plants sourced from different nurseries around the state.</p>

  <p>The record of planting maximum saplings was earlier held by Uttar Pradesh, another Indian state, which planted nearly 50 million trees in a span of 24 hours in July 2016.</p>

Don Sherman:

<blockquote>
  <p>The Vatican elects a new pope about once every 10 years. Coincidentally, or not, reborn Corvettes follow the same cadence. Speculation about the next high priest of the Milford proving ground has consumed the faithful for the past few years, only intensifying in the lead-up to the car’s official reveal at this year’s North American International Auto Show. Now, weeks before the silk comes off, we have sleuthed out all the important secrets of the seventh-generation Corvette, a.k.a. C7.</p>

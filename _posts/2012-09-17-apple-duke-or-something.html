<a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_technology/~3/u-Xjwiqi088/">Apple = Duke or something</a><br/><p>Maureen Farrell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple&rsquo;s stock is oh so close to $700. And despite iffy reviews of the iPhone 5, at least two million people are waiting for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That a lot&hellip;.wait&hellip;</p>

<p>Iffy reviews? <em>Reviews</em>?</p>

<p>Glad I read the drivel at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duke students sleep for weeks in Krzyzewskiville, the town outside Cameron stadium, to see the team on its home court.</p>
  
  <p>Like Duke&rsquo;s basketball team, Apple inspires devotion and plenty of haters.</p>
  
  <p>Last year, Duke had a miserable March with a quick exit from the NCAA tournament.</p>
  
  <p>For Apple devotees, the question is whether its stock will survive the September iPhone and $700 madness. Not everyone believes the hype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;ve made a strong case: Duke does bad sometimes.  Apple will.  Brilliant.</p>

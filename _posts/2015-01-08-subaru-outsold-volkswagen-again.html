Again.</a><br/><p>Doug DeMuro on the issues keeping Volkswagen from hitting it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/the_group/strategy.html" target="_blank">insane sales goal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, Volkswagen problem number one: this brand still does not make a credible midsize sport-utility vehicle. Folks, I don&rsquo;t know how to stress this enough. The Ford Explorer, which is widely regarded as the first hugely successful &ldquo;family car&rdquo; SUV, debuted for the 1991 model year. It came out twenty-five years ago. Next year, the very first Explorers will be eligible for collector vehicle plates. And despite the Explorer&rsquo;s popularity, and the ensuing rise of the SUV, and rivals from every brand between Mitsubishi and Hyundai, Volkswagen is still taking a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; approach to this segment. You have to wonder if the Germans are holed up in an office in Wolfsburg, staring out the window, dark suits on, telling each other that &ldquo;really, the midsize SUV is just a passing fad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hate midsize SUVs, but I love the GTI. Sometimes, you&rsquo;ve got to pay to play.</p>

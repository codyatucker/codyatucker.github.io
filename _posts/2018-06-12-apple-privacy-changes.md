Shannon Lion:

> The changes to the rules, which were made last week, explicitly state that developers are banned from turning address books into a database of contacts and from selling that database. They also can’t turn data into user profiles. Developers can still ask users for contact lists for use within their app, but they’ll have to tell users exactly what they’re going to do with the data. If they have more than one purpose in mind, they’ll have to ask for further consent.

This should be met with deafening praise.

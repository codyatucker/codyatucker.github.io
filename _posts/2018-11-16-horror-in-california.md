>(CNN) â€” The list of people who are unaccounted for as a result of the Camp Fire in Northern California has 1,011 entries, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said Friday evening.
>
>The sheriff said the list is imperfect and will fluctuate in number because it is raw data that needs to be refined.
>
>The death toll from the fire is now 71 after eight sets of remains were found Friday, Honea said. Three other deaths occurred in the Woolsey Fire in Southern California, making the statewide death toll from wildfires 74.

This is horrific. The photos are devastating. The stories are even worse. Then there's the growing number of missing people. It keeps getting worse.

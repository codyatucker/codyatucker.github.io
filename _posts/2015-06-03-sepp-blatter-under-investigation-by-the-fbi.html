<blockquote>
  <p>ABC News reported that the investigation hoped to use those indicted to provide information that could lead to charges against their superiors &ndash; much as federal agents would in a mob racketeering case.</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Now that people are going to want to save themselves, there&rsquo;s probably a race to see who will flip on [Blatter] first,&rdquo; one of the sources said, explaining how the feds typically try to get people to inform on their superiors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times is among many who seem to confirm the reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Blatter had for days tried to distance himself from the controversy, but several United States officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that in their efforts to build a case against Mr. Blatter, they were hoping to win the cooperation of some of the FIFA officials now under indictment and work their way up the organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>major</em>.</p>

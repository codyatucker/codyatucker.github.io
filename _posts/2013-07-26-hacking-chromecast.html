<blockquote>
  <p>If you are still broadcasting your Wi-Fi network without a password, here is another reason to lock it down: there is nothing to prevent any nearby compatible device from hijacking your Chromecast and displaying whatever the interloper pleases. Since Chrome tabs are broadcastable, this means porn, nyancat, Two Girls One Cup, and oh, so much more that can be put through to a Chromecast.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the proposal will reclassify high-speed Internet service as a telecommunications service, instead of an information service, under Title II of the Communications Act, according to industry analysts, lobbyists and former F.C.C. staff members.</p>
  
  <p>The change, the analysts and others say, which has been pushed by President Obama, would give the commission strong legal authority to ensure that no content is blocked and no so-called pay-to-play fast lanes exist â€” prohibitions that are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept.</p>
  
  <p>But Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, will advocate a light-touch approach to Title II, they say, shunning the more intrusive aspects of utility-style regulation, like meddling in pricing decisions. He may also suggest putting wireless data services under Title II and adding regulations for companies that manage the backbone of the Internet.</p>

<p>It could be a big win for all of us who use depend on the Internet. By &ldquo;us&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;basically everyone.&rdquo;</p>

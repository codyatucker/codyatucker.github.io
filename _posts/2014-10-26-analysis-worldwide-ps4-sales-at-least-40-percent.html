<blockquote>
  <p>Getting an accurate read on how well the new generation of consoles is selling is a difficult job, and it&rsquo;s complicated by sporadic and sometimes vague numbers provided by the console makers themselves. After taking a dive into the most recent numbers, Ars estimates that the PlayStation 4 has sold at least 42 percent more units worldwide than the Xbox One through September. This makes Sony&rsquo;s system responsible for at least 59 percent of hardware sales in the two-console market (PS4 and Xbox One).</p>

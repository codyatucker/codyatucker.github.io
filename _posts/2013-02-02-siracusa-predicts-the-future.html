<a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/02/apples-2013-to-do-list">Siracusa predicts the future</a><br/><p>John Siracusa makes the case for more iPhones:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selling models from previous years at a discount is no longer good enough. Apple can make more attractive phones at similar prices if they’re purpose-built using modern parts and processes. Margins may go down, but sales will go up. Apple has done this before, with the Mac, the iPod, and now the iPad. It’s the iPhone’s turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best explanation so far in favor of a broader line of iPhones.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I proudly told coworkers of my prediction: Apple will stay the course and release a brand new iPhone, a cheaper iPhone 5, then free iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Siracusa, I can easily see it going the other way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Journal notes that TBS used compression technology to speed up the Wizard of Oz during its airing last November, causing pop-culture writer Stephen Cox to notice that the munchkins&rsquo; voices were pitched higher than normal. TBS, TNT, and TV Land have also sped up shows including Seinfeld and Friends.</p>
  
  <p>Speeding up shows isn&rsquo;t the only way networks are trying to fit in ad time. On TNT, reruns of Law and Order have truncated opening credits—once a minute and 45 seconds long, the introduction is now just 24 seconds. “It feels wrong,” Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman told the Journal about the show&rsquo;s “squashed” opening and closing credits. “It is not how it was shot, written, or imagined. It wasn’t meant to be that way, so don’t make it that way.&ldquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about the $$$$$.</p>

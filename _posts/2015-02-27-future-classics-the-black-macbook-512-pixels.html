<blockquote>
  <p>At $1,499, the black model was exactly the same machine as the white one with the difference of a larger hard drive. As $200 for 20 GB of storage was viewed as robbery, the machine’s price earned a nickname: the so-called “black tax.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The black Macbook was my first useful Apple computer. I owned a white one in the year prior, but it quickly succumbed to logic board issues and <a href="http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/1773_large_165320545_fabb62b271_o.jpg" target="_blank">gastly yellowing</a>.</p>

<p>My second Macbook - black plastic, 2.0GHz - was an absolute peach. I only had one issue with the battery, but that was from keeping it plugged in too often. Other than that, it served me splendidly throughout my university career, and I miss it dearly to this day.</p>

<p>I sold it in order to fund my current iMac, an amazing machine, but I still wish I could have kept the trusty blackbook.</p>

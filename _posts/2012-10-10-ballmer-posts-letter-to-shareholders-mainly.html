<blockquote>
  <p>Last year in this letter I said that over time, the full value of our software will be seen and felt in how people use devices and services at work and in their personal lives. This is a significant shift, both in what we do and how we see ourselves â€” as a devices and services company. It impacts how we run the company, how we develop new experiences, and how we take products to market for both consumers and businesses. The work we have accomplished in the past year and the roadmap in front of us brings this to life.</p>

<p>Any way the wind blows.</p>

<p>The old way of Windows is not sustainable.  The new way of Xbox is.  For now.</p>

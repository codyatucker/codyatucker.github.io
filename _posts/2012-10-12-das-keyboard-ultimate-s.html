<p>This is a test of the Das Keyboard. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think of it.</p>

<p>I bought the <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/" target="_blank">Ultimate S model</a> with the MX Brown switches.  The brown switches are supposed to be the quiet ones, so the idea was that I could use this guy at work, where I&rsquo;m typing for 8 hours a day.</p>

<p>First impression:  There&rsquo;s no way I can use this thing at work.   I&rsquo;m bottoming out&hellip;alot, which makes it exponentially louder than the typical membrane keyboard.</p>

<p>At home, I possibly could get used to using the Das Keyboard.  The sound is kind of nice, but I&rsquo;m hearing a very noticeable reverberation coming from each key press.  I&rsquo;m not sure if this will wear on me over time, or simply become &ldquo;what working sounds like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, I feel like I may end up returning the keyboard because:</p>

<ol><li>$130 is a lot of money.</li>
<li>Even though it&rsquo;s the quiet one, it&rsquo;s still pretty loud.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not yet convinced it will make me a better typist than I already am.</li>
<li>My co-workers would kill me if I used it at work. (Granted I could keep it and use it at home, but at this point I don&rsquo;t use my iMac enough to warrant the expense.</li>
</ol><p>Stay tuned.</p>

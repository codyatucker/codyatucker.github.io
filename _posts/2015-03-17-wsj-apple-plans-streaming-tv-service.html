<blockquote>
  <p>Rumors of an Apple-created television service have been around for almost as long as the rumors about an Apple-created television set, but a new report from the Wall Street Journal suggests we may know more soon. The WSJ claims that Apple will be launching a 25-or-so channel TV service for $30 or $40 a month that would include ABC, CBS, Fox, and various subsidiary channels like ESPN and FX.</p>
  
  <p>NBC is not part of the current talks, apparently because of conflicts with parent company Comcast. Apple&rsquo;s plans had previously been expected to include some kind of partnership with cable companies, combining their infrastructure and content with Apple&rsquo;s hardware and software. The Journal says those plans have been nixed, again because of friction with Comcast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So things are finally <a href="https://www.sling.com/" target="_blank">moving in the right direction</a>, but I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;re going to get stuck in a situation where no single service has the precise mix of channels. The goal is to make TV more affordable and accessible, but that&rsquo;s not the case if I have to pay for several different services just to get the content I want.</p>

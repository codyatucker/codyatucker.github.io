<a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-mini-for-content-creation/">iPad mini For Content Creation</a><br/><p>Great points made by the great Viticci:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judging the “creation” capabilities of the iPad by its screen size misses the point. The iPad mini is a great device for content creation – in fact, I’d argue that because of its smaller screen, lighter body, and higher portability, the iPad mini can be better than the full-size iPad Air for work and productivity tasks. And, because of the larger screen, I could argue that the iPad Air is more suited for activities that benefit from a larger viewing area, such as playing games, watching movies, or browsing photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more I look at it, the more advantages I see in the iPad mini with Retina display.  It’s sheer “holdability” fascinates me.</p>

<p>For example, I do a lot of my writing slouched on the couch, iPad 3 in both hands, using the split keyboard. It all works fine, but wouldn’t the Mini work better?</p>

<p>The iPad Air would make that same situation much better. But why pay the extra $100 for “the big one?”</p>

<p>Instead of dropping $599 for a 32GB Wi-Fi model, I could instead pay $30 more for a Retina Mini with Wi-Fi, add LTE.  I’m ultimately buying a <em>more</em> capable device for less.  Fascinating.</p>

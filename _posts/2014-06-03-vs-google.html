<a href="http://www.codytucker.net/index/vs-google">vs. Google</a><br/><p><a href="http://ift.tt/1pfE9Tu" target="_blank">Apple&rsquo;s WWDC 2014 Keynote</a> was a behemoth. I was exhausted by the end of the OS X portion, and there was still over and hour worth of content.</p>

<p>But enough of that. Let&rsquo;s talk about Craig Federighi. The Senior VP of Software Engineering was absolutely on fire.  Confident, (usually) Funny. Knowledgable. Whether true or not, it sure felt like he could have led the keynote all by himself.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m struck by the number of little pokes and jabs thrown Google&rsquo;s way throughout the presentation. Tim Cook and Federighi each made blatant jabs at Android fragmentation, but the right hook was the silent killer called Spotlight.</p>

<p>Apple wants you to use Spotlight for <em>all</em> searches, both local system searched <em>and</em> web searches. </p>

<p>It says so on the preview page<a href="http://ift.tt/19ZuKpL" target="_blank">the preview page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a new search window and rich, scrollable previews of your results, Spotlight makes it easier than ever to find things on your Mac. And now it finds information from Wikipedia, Bing, Maps, and other sources,Â too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: If you want to find something-no matter what it is-start with Spotlight, not Google. This is equally true for OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.</p>

<p>My favorite bit wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned in the keynote: You can change the default search engine to <a href="http://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>

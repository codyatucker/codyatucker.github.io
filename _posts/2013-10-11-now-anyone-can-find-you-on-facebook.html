<blockquote>
  <p>Simply put, the setting let people hide their Timelines &ndash; aka profiles &ndash; from public view. Members could use it to control if they could be found, and by whom, when other people typed their name into the Facebook search bar.</p>

<p>Hiding from search gave me the peace of mind to only use Facebook to chat with a small handful of people.</p>

<p>Now those days are over.  I should have been exploring other options.</p>

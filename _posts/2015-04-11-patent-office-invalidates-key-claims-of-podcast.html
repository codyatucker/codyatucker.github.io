<a href="http://cir.ca/s/PFX">Patent Office invalidates key claims of 'podcast patent'</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 10 invalidated several key claims of a patent that was used to sue several well-known podcasters. The invalidation means that the so-called &ldquo;podcasting patent&rdquo; can no longer be used to sue podcasters. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an advocacy group, had petitioned against the patent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a win.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sling TV (not to be confused with the Slingbox television set-top box), can be accessed on the iPhone and iPad via an iOS app. Dish is offering users a seven day free trial, so you can see if this &ldquo;cord-cutting&rdquo; option is right for you before paying the monthly fee. In addition to the $20 tier, which offers a collection of 15 channels, customers can pay for additional collections of sports, news and kids channels for $5 a month each.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m extremely tempting to make the leap. I would be giving up a couple of channels, but I would save upwards of $60/month. With Dish, I have to pay for one of (if not <em>the</em>) highest tiers just so I can watch soccer on NBCSN and beIN Sports.</p>

<p>I was also concerned about the lack of DVR, until I read the company&rsquo;s <a href="http://help.sling.com/FAQs" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. Sling TV includes a 3-day replay feature that allows you to watch shows that have aired in the past three days on the following channels: HGTV, DIY, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, Food Network, Galavision, El Rey, Univision Deportes, Universal Sports, and beIN Sports and we expect this list to grow. Sling International customers can enjoy exclusive 8-day replay on all international channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the biggest downfall is the lack of device support. I have very little interest in watching from a mobile device. We have an old Roku sitting around, but I would much prefer to watch from my Apple TV and Playstation 4. I assume support for both device is on the way, but it can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new figures come from comScore, which says in its new mobile measurement report that Instagram, recently purchased by Facebook, averaged 7.3 million daily active users in the month of August, while Twitter averaged 6.9 million over the same period. The research firmâ€™s figures also showed that Instagram users are spending more time interacting with the service than are Twitter users.</p>

<p>The last bit is not surprising, as it simply takes long to snap, edit, and post a picture.</p>

<p>The first, however, should be a huge concern, given how hard TV and the web are pushing people to Twitter.</p>

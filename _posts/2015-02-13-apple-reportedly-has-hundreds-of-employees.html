<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is reportedly moving beyond computers and mobile devices to take on the likes of Tesla Motors in the electric car market, the Wall Street Journal says (paywall). Apple reportedly has “hundreds of employees” working on a project codenamed “Titan,” a secret plan to build a minivan-shaped electric vehicle.</p>

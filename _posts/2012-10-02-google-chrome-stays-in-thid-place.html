<blockquote>
  <p>Once again, Firefox has maintained its grip on second place, behind Internet Explorer. And as Chrome falls away, there&rsquo;s now a gap of more than one percentage point between the browsers.</p>
  
  <p>During 2011, Chrome&rsquo;s rise was unstoppable, and it looked as if taking second place was an inevitability. In 2012, Google&rsquo;s browser has come close, but never quite managed to close the gap even with Google&rsquo;s extensive advertising and promotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m back to Safari now.  Both Chrome and Firefox have such a  share of quirks, it&rsquo;s just easier to use the stock goodness.  iOS 6&rsquo;s new syncing features help a lot.</p>

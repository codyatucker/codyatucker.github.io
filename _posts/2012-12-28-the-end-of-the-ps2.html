<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Sony drove the final nail into the console&rsquo;s coffin. Famitsu reports that Sony has stopped shipping the console in Japan; once the current inventory in the channel is sold out, no new PS2s will be available for purchase. This puts an end to hardware that first launched in March of 2000, has sold over 150 million units, and (according to Sony) can play well over 10,000 games.</p>

<p>What an incredible run.  It&rsquo;s lasted this long, and yet, I never purchased one.</p>

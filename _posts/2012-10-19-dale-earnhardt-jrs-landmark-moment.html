<p>Marty Smith views it as an important moment in sports history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Few human qualities are as dynamic as vulnerability. Those self-confident enough to acknowledge the deepest part of their personal weaknesses are in fact the strongest among us. Just are. They&rsquo;re on another level spiritually. It takes indescribable guts to peer into your soul that deeply, because you may not like what you learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>

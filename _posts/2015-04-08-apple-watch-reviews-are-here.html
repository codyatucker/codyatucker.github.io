<a href="http://mashable.com/2015/04/08/apple-watch-meta-review/">Apple Watch reviews are here!</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;m bummed that the embargo fell at 8 a.m., instead of the usual midnight PST. That means I missed the initial review onslaught by a couple of hours. I sleep too much.</p>

<p>Anyways, Mashable is compiling a nifty cheat sheet as the reviews come out. In a perfect world, we would read every word of every review. It&rsquo;s just too bad we don&rsquo;t have the time.</p>

<p>The reviews, so far, are appropriately mixed. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch" target="_blank">John Gruber&rsquo;s review</a> is a great place to start. It seems pretty fair, and a good indication of just how new and unique this device is.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it should be no surprise that the Apple Watch is polarizing at launch. Such has been the case with every new product that Apple has ever released.</p>

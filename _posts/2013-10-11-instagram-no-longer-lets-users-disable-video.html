<blockquote>
  <p>While the change may seem minor, it is significant for Instagram’s pitch to advertisers because it maximizes the audience eyeballs for ad spots. Now every iOS user on a WiFi connection, and those who don’t opt out of autoplay on cellular — which is set as default within the app — will watch, at least the beginning, of any video in their stream.</p>

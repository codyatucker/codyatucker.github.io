<blockquote>
  <p>It’s already amazing that there exists gadgets made of of aluminum and glass, which weighs less than a pound, and have screens which rivals the resolution of a printed magazine. Now add to that the fact these devices have touch screens so true-to-life and so responsive that it feels as if you’re literally manipulating the pixels with your fingers.</p>

<p>What an age we live in.</p>

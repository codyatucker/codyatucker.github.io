<blockquote>
  <p>The staffing question is more interesting, and, perhaps, more complex. If Apple does carve out some private space in all of their stores for high-end clientele, I think the company may have a problem here as well. Many stores I have visited staffed by mostly young people, and while they may be wearing polo shirts these days, there’s no getting around the fact that Apple Stores may just have the wrong kind of sales clerks to sell a $10,000 watch. That’s delicate and awkward, but I think it’s true.</p>
  
  <p>I’m starting to think the Apple Watch Edition will not be available at all of Apple’s stores immediately. I can see it being in select Apple Stores in cities like New York, L.A., London and Paris.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>If someone walks into any old Apple Store and says, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s $XXXXX, give me the Edition,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure that store will be prepared to accommodate them. Otherwise, it really doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have them available in every single market. Not at launch.</p>

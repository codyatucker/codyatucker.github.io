>(Reuters) - The official death toll on Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to strike the Caribbean island in almost a century, was raised on Tuesday from just 64 to nearly 3,000, based on a study ordered by the governor of the U.S. territory.

2,996 died on [9/11](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks).

Between 1,245â€“1,836 were killed by [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina).

The response to the death toll from Maria is woefully lacking.

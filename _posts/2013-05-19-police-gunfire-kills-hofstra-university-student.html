<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/18/us/new-york-student-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">Police gunfire kills Hofstra University student</a><br/><p>CNN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Police fired eight shots at the intruder, who authorities say was holding a gun to the head of 21-year-old Andrea Rebello during a home invasion robbery Friday at an off-campus house in Uniondale.</p>
  
  <p>One of the shots hit Rebello in the head, killing her, police spokeswoman Maureen Roach said.</p>
  
  <p>Also killed was the intruder, who authorities identified as Dalton Smith, 30, of Hempstead. He was struck seven times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comments section below the story is a cesspool of genius.  Says &ldquo;NYC2AZ&rdquo; about the suspects violent criminal history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why aren&rsquo;t the news agencies asking the questions about why these individuals were released? Who sentenced/released them? Why don&rsquo;t we see the outrage from the public about these individuals that have a proven (usually extensive) track record of crime that directly results in the harming or death of their victims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only we were <em>all</em> in jail, then I suppose, based on this logic, there would be no violence.</p>

<p>In seriousness, the commenter&rsquo;s had 237 &ldquo;up votes&rdquo; though their criteria for a life prison sentence is murky at best.</p>

<p>Better immediate questions:  Was the officer alone? If so, why then did the officer approach a suspect who was holding a loaded gun at a victims head, all by himself?  Did he have any training in this type of situation?  Do <em>all</em> officers get training for this type of situation?  What is an officer <em>supposed</em> to do in a situation like this?  How did this home invasion end up with a gun to a woman&rsquo;s head, with three other victims outside the home?</p>

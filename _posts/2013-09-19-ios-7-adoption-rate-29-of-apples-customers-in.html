<blockquote>
  <p>According to Tim Cook, Apple will sell its 700th million iOS device next month.Â As of last January, roughly half of the iOS devices sold were still in use. If that ratio holds, it puts the number of downloads at roughly 100 million, or 6.3 million per hour. At 1.2 gigabytes per iPhone download (1.3GB for iPad) that&rsquo;s nearly 2.2 terabytes per second.</p>
  
  <p>Could that explain why by Wednesday afternoon Internet traffic was running at 112%, with hotspots in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. where iPhone adoption is highest?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has accused President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle of parenting by double-standard, in an interview published Tuesday, saying they shelter their daughters from some things but allow them to listen to the music of Beyoncé.</p>
  
  <p>While promoting his new book, Huckabee told People magazine, “I don’t understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything — how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school … and yet they don’t see anything that might not be suitable” in the lyrics and a Beyoncé choreography “best left for the privacy of her bedroom.”</p>
  
  <p>Huckabee described the Grammy Award-winning Beyoncé in his book as “mental poison.”</p>

<p>Mediaite felt the same way I did, given how Huckabee once PERFORMED CAT SCRATCH FEVER ON HIS TELEVISION SHOW.</p>

<p>CAT SCRATCH FEVER.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oddly enough, Huckabee doesn’t seem to have a problem with sexually-charged music when it comes from burly conservative dudes in camo hunting vests or aged rockers in leather pants.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, Huckabee once performed “Cat Scratch Fever” with Ted Nugent. Some lyrics from this not-so-subtle song about wanting to bang everything in sight:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Well, the first time that I got it I was just ten years old / I got it from some kitty next door / An’ I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure / I think I got it some more / […] / Well, I make the pussy purr with the stroke of my hand / They know they gettin’ it from me / They know just where to go when they need their lovin’ man / They know I’m doin’ it for free.</p>

<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121029/welcome-to-the-jony-ive-era-apple/">Jony Ive runs all of Apple product design</a><br/><p>John Paczkowski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while details of the ousters of Scott Forstall and John Browett — the guy who oversaw Apple’s iOS operating system and the new hire who ran its retail stores, are certainly intriguing — they’re a sideshow to the bigger story here: The clear ascendancy of design chief Jony Ive.</p>
  
  <p>That’s because on Monday, Ive was given a role that no executive other than co-founder Steve Jobs has ever held before — oversight of all Apple product design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish nothing but the absolute best for Scott Forstall.  What he has accomplished with iOS is simply unprecedented.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this seems like the right decision.  The <em>obvious</em> decision.</p>

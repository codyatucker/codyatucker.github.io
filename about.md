I'm Cody Tucker. After years of struggling to find a home for my personal blog, I've finally wrapped my head around a solution that gives me more control over my content than ever before. I want codytucker.net to serve as the home base for my entire online presence, with as much content coming *from* this is site as possible.

This site is built using [jekyll](jekyll-organization) with hosting handled by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The design is a modified version the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

The [archive](https://codytucker.net/archive) was built using code written by [Chris House](http://chris.house/blog/building-a-simple-archive-page-with-jekyll/).

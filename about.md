I'm Cody Tucker. After years of struggling to find a home for my personal blog, I've finally wrapped my head around a solution that gives me more control over my content than ever before. I want codytucker.net to serve as the home base for my entire online presence, with most, if not all "content" coming from this is site.

This site is built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with hosting handled by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is a modified version of [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

The [archive](https://codytucker.net/archive) was built using code written by [Chris House](http://chris.house/blog/building-a-simple-archive-page-with-jekyll/).
